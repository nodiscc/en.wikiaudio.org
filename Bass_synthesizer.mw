The '''bass synthesizer''' (or "bass synth") is an electronic instrument capable of producing a variety of sounds by generating and combining signals of different frequencies. A modern digital synthesizer uses a frequency synthesizer microprocessor component to generate signals of different frequencies. Bass synths create sounds in the bass range that range from simulations of the electric bass or double bass to distorted, buzz-saw-like artificial bass sounds. While most bass synths are controlled by electronic keyboards, some performers use an electric bass with MIDI pickups to trigger a bass synthesizer. Bass synth patches incorporate a range of sounds and tones, including wavetable-style, analog, and FM-style bass sounds, delay effects, distortion effects, envelope filters.
