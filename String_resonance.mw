'''String resonance''' occurs on [[string instruments]]. Strings or parts of strings may resonate at their [[fundamental]] or [[overtone]] frequencies when other strings are sounded. For example, an A string at 440 Hz will cause an E string at 330 Hz to resonate, because they share an overtone of 1320 Hz (3rd overtone of A and 4th overtone of E).

[[Electric guitar]]s can have [[string tree (instrument)|string tree]]s near the tuning pegs to mute this type of [[reverberation]]. The string length behind the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] also must be as short as possible to prevent the resonance.
String resonance is a factor in the [[timbre]] of a string instrument. [[Tailed bridge guitar]]s like the [[Fender Jaguar]] differ in [[timbre]] from guitars with short bridges, because of their (extended) [[floating bridge]]. The Japanese [[Koto (musical instrument)|Koto]] is also a good example of an instrument with occurring string resonance.

==String resonance in instrument building==
Sometimes string resonance is used in the construction of the instrument, like for instance the [[Sympathetic strings]] in many Eastern instruments.

====Piano====
According to a 2007 [[Grove Music Online]] article on "duplex scaling", [[Steinway]] developed a system of [[Aliquot stringing]] to provide sympathetic resonance, with the intention of enriching the treble register of the piano. In the "octave duplex" piano by [[Hoerr]] of [[Toronto]], each note had four strings, of which two, three or four could be struck by the hammer depending on the depression of any of four pedals. Steinwayâ€™s [[duplex scale]] was inspired a half century earlier by an experiment conducted by the German piano maker [[Wilhelm Leberecht Petzoldt]], in which a small bridge was placed behind the standard larger one with the intention of maximizing the potential additional resonance of a sympathetically vibrating additional length of string.

==Overtones due to string resonance on the koto==

shows the created resonating overtones on the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] for various positions on a stopped string (the proportion being between the "played" portion of the string and resonant portion, the remaining length of the string).
