First, make sure you know what physical MIDI ports your external MIDI devices are connected to.

#Open up the Mac OS's '''Audio MIDI setup'''. This is in the '''Applications / Utility''' folder
#Go to '''Window''' (menu) & choose '''MIDI devices'''.
#Add a virtual device for every real device you have connected to your MIDI interface. You can do this by clicking the '''"Add Device"''' button..
#When the device appears, double click on it and set the '''Manufacturer''' and '''Model''' fields for your device(s)and make sure all channel buttons for input and output are enabled.
#Then, connect the virtual MIDI cables from the device(s) to the interface to reflect how they are connected physically.

Repeat these steps for every device that you have connected to your MIDI interface.


==Mac OS Audio setup==


To setup the outputs on Mac OS you have to open the Audio MIDI Setup.This defaults to being in the '''Utilities''' folder.
Once open, choose the '''Audio Devices tab'''



==Default inputs and Outputs==

These are the default inputs and outputs that the Mac OS will read and send signal from. When you launch a DAW program such as Logic or Pro Tools, the internal hardware driver settings of the software will (usually) take precedence over these settings. 

==Clock source==

This is used to determine what device is the [[Word clock|digital clock]] source.
