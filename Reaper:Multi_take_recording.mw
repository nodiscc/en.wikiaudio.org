In [[Reaper]] to do multiple takes :

#[[Reaper:Cycle loop playback|Turn on the playback/record cycle.]] If you want to do multiple takes without cycling you can do that as well, in that case you would simply record "over" your previous take.
#Begin recording , when you are done you should see a series of takes represented in the track you recorded on. (image below)
