An '''optical compressor''' or sometimes called ''opto-compressor'' is a dynamic range attenuator where the
gain reduction is controlled via a light source into a photo sensitive cell. The light intensity attenuates the amplifier volume and hence creates the compression effect.<ref>[http://www.mercenary.com/whocoandwhma.html Mercenary audio - Whats an "Opto" Compressor?]</ref>
