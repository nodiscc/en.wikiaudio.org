To '''Ghost gate''' a snare track do these things.


Split the snare track to two channels.

Gate one severely and send ''that'' track to a reverb unit but keep the channel itself ''out'' of the L/R mix.

Mix the reverb affected signal with the dry split (the one on the other channel)

By doing this you can reap the benefits of a nice sounding reverb without (or less) leakage from other drum instruments (kick, hat etc)
