==General guidelines==


===Microphone placement===
'''Each technique begins with a bullet point'''

*'''Kick drum with no hole in front head''' - Place your hand in front of the kick drum while the drum plays quoter notes and move your hand until you feel a shock wave being projected.Now mover your hand around until you feel the shock wave disappear.Put the microphone right at the edge of the shock wave.<ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook.Page 118.ISBN 1-93292-900-2</ref>

*'''Kick drum with hole in front head''' - Place the microphone 1 inch away outside of the hole, and angle it 45 degrees off axis.<ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook.Page 120.ISBN 1-93292-900-2</ref>

*Place the microphone off center from the beater and 3-4 inches inside the outer head. <ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook.Page 119.ISBN 1-93292-900-2</ref>

*You can tape a coin to the part of the drum that the beater hits to create a more aggressive sound.<ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook.Page 120.ISBN 1-93292-900-2</ref>

*Place an AKG D112 pointed 3 inches below the beater.This creates an attack with less "click" sound.For more "click" sound place the microphone closer to the beater.

*For a sound similar to the old  "Sun Records sound" try using one microphone, the same microphone, to mic the kick drum and bass at the same time. Sam Phillips used an RCA Victor ribbon microphone.He focused on micing the kick drum then had the bass player move closer (in front of the kick) when necessary. <ref name="TEEORPage29">The Expert Encyclopedia of Recording Interview with James Dickenson Page 29 ISBN 1-931140-11-1</ref>
