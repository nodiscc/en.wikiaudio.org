'''Attack time''' can refer to one of two definitions

#The period at the beginning of a sounds envelope in which a sound's attribute (such as volume) increases from 0 (silence) to it's maximum level.
#The time between (a) the instant that a signal at the input of a device or circuit exceeds the activation threshold of the device or circuit and (b) the instant that the device or circuit reacts in a specified manner, or to a specified degree, to the input. Attack time occurs in devices such as clippers, peak limiters, compressors, and voxes.
