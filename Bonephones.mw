'''Bonephones''' are headsets that create vibrations against the head, in order to transmit sound to a listener via bone conduction. The term "bonephones" is generally used to describe modern lightweight bone-conduction headsets that are designed for applied use with auditory displays, rather the traditional bone-conduction vibrators used in clinical audiology settings. Bonephones are distinguished from clinical devices by their potential for stereo presentation of sounds, their small size, comfort, and standardized input jack.
