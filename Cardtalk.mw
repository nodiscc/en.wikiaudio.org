'''CardTalk''' is an inexpensive player for recordings on vinyl records. It consists of a flat piece of cardboard creased and folded into a modified triangle shape. The base has a nub to hold the record in place. The upper "arm" forms the "pointy" part the triangle and has a needle which is placed upon the record. The record is spun using a small stick like a pencil. The cardboard picks up the impressions on the record and vibrates enough to be heard causing the "Card" to "Talk".
