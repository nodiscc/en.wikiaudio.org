==A Minor==

        

#Place your index finger on the 2nd string, 1st fret
#Place your middle finger on the 4th string, 2nd fret
#Place your ring finger on the 3rd string, 2nd fret
#Start from the 5th string and strum all of the strings in quick succession. Do not play the 6th string.


The A Minor Chord is similar to the A Major chord (as you can see), although many people
think that it is easier to play (due to the fact that you don' have to
squeeze all of your fingers onto one fret. Practice moving back and
forth between the Major and Minor versions of the A Chord.
