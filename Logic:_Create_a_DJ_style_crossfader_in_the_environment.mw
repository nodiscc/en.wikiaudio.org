===Logic:Creating a DJ style cross fader in the environment===

====Method 1====


#In Logics environment you must first add a fader object and a transform object ('''Environment / New''')
#Cable one output of the fader to an audio channel and then cable the another output to the transformer object.
#Double click the transformer object and set it's internal settings to reflect the image below (data byte two of the operations should be set to '''Reverse''')
#Now cable the output of the transformer object to a different audio channel.
#When you move the fader objects slider it should now cross fade the two audio channels
