The '''Solina String Synthesizer''' is a hybrid model which combined both the Solina String Ensemble and the ARP Explorer monophonic synthesizer. It was built in Bodegraven, Netherlands. Supposedly only about 100 were ever produced. The addition of the ARP Explorer to the Solina string sounds made for a very powerful combination.

This synth had four keyboard modes:

* Strings Only
* Strings through the Explorer low-pass filter
* Explorer voice combined with the lower Solina keyboard (contrabass and cello)
* Explorer voice combined with the upper Solina keyboard (viola, violin, trumpet, horn)
