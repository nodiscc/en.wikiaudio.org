==Recording Brass instruments==

*Recording brass instruments close can easily lead to recording the clicks,air leak,spit and tongue noise associated with such instruments. To mediate this you can point the mic a bit off axis, mic directly from a distance or a combination of both.

*Place the mic 3-4 feet back, above the bell and pointed at the mouthpiece.

*Al Schmitt is quoted as saying he uses a 67 (Neumann U67) for recording trumpets.He places the microphone 3-4 feet back, keeps the pad on and sets it to omnidirectional. <ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook. Page 104. ISBN 1-93292-900-2</ref>
