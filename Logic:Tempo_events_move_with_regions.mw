You can make tempo events ''follow'' regions as they are moved. To do so follow these steps.

'''1.''' Go to the tempo event list. '''Lists / Tempo'''

2.  Select the tempo events you want from the list that correlate with the region you wish to move.

3. Hold '''Shift''' and select the region(s) you wish to move. Move them and the tempo events should now follow them.
