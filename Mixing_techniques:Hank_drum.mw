=====Steel tongue drum with distortion effect=====

Below is a Logic Pro session run down of how the following audio file was mixed. 

*<flashmp3>File:Hank drum with distortion.mp3</flashmp3>

[[:File:Hank drum with distortion.wav|Wav file download]]


The initial recording was done Inside the drum  using a [[Crowley and Tripp Naked Eye]] Ribbon microphone

The same recording was then copied to three different tracks.

The first two channels are mixed together using different compression and EQ settings. The third is strictly the distortion effect (with EQ) and the channel is muted until the effect is desired.
