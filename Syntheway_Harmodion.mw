* 9 Drawbars. By sliding drawbars in or out, the user can mix various pitches and create the richly distinctive sounds of an electric organ or of a free reed aerophone instrument. 
* The Additive synthesis constructs complex sounds by controlling the level of individual sine-wave components. The sound can be reshaped by alterations made to timbre. A harmonic sound could be restructured to sound inharmonic, and vice versa. 
* The rich harmonic content of their sound allows to generate the widest palette of tonal variations for Drawbar organs, Reed organs and Squeezeboxes emulations. 
* Vibrato effect, with depth and speed modulation controls. 
* Adjustable Key Click simulation to add the percussive effect for distinctive organ sounds and button click noise in Accordion and Bandoneon presets.  
* Configurable Drive level. Accomplished by clipping the input signal, this effect adds sustain and additional harmonics and overtones to the signal, creating a richer sound with a warm thickness regarding to the original tone. 
* 32 Presets available for immediate use in a wide range of genres from blues, jazz, gospel and rock styles to folk, ethnic and popular music. 
* Full MIDI Automation: Complete MIDI Continuous Controller (Control of all parameters for use with external hardware control).
