You can control a [[MIDI]] compatible synth with your guitar by using a MIDI pickup or a device like  the "Sonuus G2M Universal Guitar To MIDI Converter". It's monophonic and  under $100. This will allow you to trigger  individual MIDI (synth)  notes with your guitar. Additionally you could use this with a  combination of  software and a MIDI sending foot controller device to toggle different  effects on and off.
