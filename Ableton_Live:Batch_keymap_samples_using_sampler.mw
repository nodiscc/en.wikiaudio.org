If you would like to import a large number of audio samples in [[Ableton Live]] and [[keymap]] them to ''individual'' keys , do these things.


'''1.''' Open up an instance of the [[Ableton Live:Add instrument device|'''Sampler''' instrument]]

'''2.''' Select all the audio files you would like to keymap at one time and drag them to the sampler.You can either do this by dragging samples from [[Ableton Live:Toggle between session and arrange windows|Lives session or arrange view]] or from a directory on your computer.
