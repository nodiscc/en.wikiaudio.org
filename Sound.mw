'''Sound''' is a longitudinal [[waveform|wave]] vibration created by an object and transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas.Particularly, sound means those vibrations composed of [[frequency|frequencies]] capable of being detected by ears.

==Formulas==

===Speed of sound through air===

*In dry air at 1 atmospheric pressure and <math>0^{\circ}C</math> the speed of sound is <math>331.4</math>  <math>m/s</math>

*The speed increases with temperature at the rate of <math>0.61</math> <math>m/s^{\circ}C</math>

*The speed of sound in dry air at 1 atmospheric pressure is then <math>V=331.4+(0.610)t_c</math>  
**<math>t_c</math> = Air Temperature <math>(^oC)</math>

===Speed of sound through gasses===


The speed of sound through an ''ideal'' gas is expressed by the formula 

<math>v=\frac{\sqrt{\gamma = RT}}{M}</math>


Where

*'''v''' = speed of sound
*'''R''' = universal gas constant
*'''T''' = absolute temprature (K)
*'''M''' = molecular mass of gas (Kg/mol)
**The average molecular mass <math>(M)</math> for dry air is <math>28.95 g/mol</math>
*'''<math>\gamma</math>''' = adiabatic constant 
**For ''air'' adiabatic constant '''<math>\gamma =1.4</math>'''

===Doppler Effect===

If a sound emitting source and listener move along the same straight line the listener will hear sound of the frequency:

<math>f_o = f_s\left(
 \frac{v\pm v_o}{v\mp v_s}
 \right)</math>


*<math>fs</math> = the source sound frequency

*<math>fo</math> = the observer sound frequency

*<math>vo</math> = the realative speed of the observer 

*<math>vs</math> = the relative speed of the source

*<math>v</math> =  the sound speed in this medium
