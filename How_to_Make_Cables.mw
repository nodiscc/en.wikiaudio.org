[[RCA]] cables, used in home television, Computers, consoles, [[mixer]]s, amplifiers and other [[audio]] equipment that gets modified electrically may require a good cable for sound fidelity. Cables bought in stores may cost a lot more than what you can make with the basic material.








== Things you'll need ==
* Lengths of wire with respectable gauge 
* Wire strippers
* Cutters
* A crimper
* Connectors
* A solder iron
* (Leadless) Solder
* Heatshrink tubing

== Steps ==
# Cut your cables to the length you need.
# Strip the ends by turning the wire stripper 360 degrees clockwise than counter-clockwise to ensure a nice cut, then pull it out.
# Put on some solder to the exposed part of the wire.
# Insert two heatshrink tubing about one inch long each onto your cable.
# Put on your connectors.
# Crimp them firmly.
# Add some more solder.
# Solder another length of cable if you have a ground pin.
# Heat the shrink around the connector
# Test with a ohmmeter and a "load".

== Tips ==
* Calculate the length of wire you need and add a little extra. Cables should not be dangling or enrolled onto itself. When cables cross each other, it creates interference.
* Calculate the gauge according to the length of the cable and the amount of impedance it will carry.
