==General guidelines==

Placing the microphone directly at the speakers cone will give a brighter sound, placing the mic off axis at the cone creates a more "mellow" sound. <ref>Modern Recording Techniques. Page 156. ISBN 0-240-80625-5</ref>

===Microphone placement===
'''Each technique begins with a bullet point'''

*Try a cardioid dynamic microphone placed anywhere from 2 inches to a foot away from the speaker cone.
*Combine more than one mic and make sure their in phase, or make them out of phase and exploit the out-of-phase characteristic for a different tone.
