==Snare drum: reamp==


'''1.'''Run the snare track of the song through a gate.The gate should be set to open when the snare drum hits & closes completely when it doesn't. The result should be a "short and tight" drum sound that sounds a bit unnatural. 

'''2.'''Patch the output of the gate to a re-amping device. 

'''3.'''Take a small guitar amp & place it on its back with the speaker facing up toward the ceiling. Place the physical snare drum on top of it

'''4.'''Plug the guitar cable into the amp and flip the ground switch on and off to find which position minimizes hum. 

'''5.'''Play back the gated snare track and experiment with the amps volume level until the hits playing through the guitar amp make the physical snare give off a "snap" sound. 

'''6.'''Place a microphone 6 to 10 inches from the snare. A small diaphragm condenser is preferable but a good quality dynamic microphone can work as well. 

'''7.'''Experiment with positioning the microphone until you like the sound. Try positioning it in a manner whereby you can hear some of the "shell sound" from the side of the drum.

'''8.'''Play back the entire song and record the re-amped snare signal to a new track

'''9.'''Mix the new track with the rest of the song including the original snare track. If you are recording digitally you might want to move the re-amped snare track a little bit forward to compensate for latency
