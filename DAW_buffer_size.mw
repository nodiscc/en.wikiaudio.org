A [[DAW]]'s  '''buffer size''' controls the size of the hardware cache used to handle host based tasks.



'''What this means in practical terms:'''

*Lower buffer sizes reduce monitor [[latency]] when recording and monitoring live input.
*Higher buffer settings allow for more real-time audio processing such as plug in effects.
