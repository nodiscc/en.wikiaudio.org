You can now change the tempo of the file and it will now play faster or slower depending on how you set it.

Keep in mid that you can usually turn up the tempo quite a bit before the sound begins to sound too artificial, however you cannot slow the tempo down that much before the sound begins to "degrade'.


You can now export the file by going to '''File>Export'''


Make sure the export as one sample feature is enabled ('''Process > Export as One Sample''') or you will export a file for every "slice".
