==Adding Pitch instruments==

This type of key mapping assumes that the samples you load are a multisampled pitched 
instrument (like guitar, piano, flute etc.). 

#Load the samples. 
#Click “Select All” on the Edit menu - this will select all the loaded samples.
#Click “Set Root Notes from Pitch Detection” to automatically set up the root notes (pitches) for the samples. 
#Select “Automap Zones” from the Edit menu.


==Keymap editing==

In the remote editor panel you can see a representation of how the samples fall on the keyboard. The horizontal bars represent a sample and where it is placed. You can click and drag the left and right edges of this bar and move it , hence moving where the sample is placed on the keyboard.

You can also keymap the sample(s) by selecting them in the remote editor panel and then moving the ''root'' , ''low key'' and ''high key'' knobs
