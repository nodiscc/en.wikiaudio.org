* Mic Input Response
* Gain range = 0dB to 60dB in 10dB steps
* Input Impedance, variable as follows:-

'''Switched Impedance setting Equivalent Input Impedance at 1kHz'''
* Low 600
* ISA 110 1400
* Med (Medium) 2400
* High 6800

'''EIN (equivalent input noise) = -126dB measured at 60dB of gain with 150 Ohm terminating impedance and'''
* 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* Noise at main output with gain at unity (0dB) = -97dBu measured with a 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* Signal-to-noise ratio relative to max headroom (9dBu) = 106dB
* THD at medium gain (30dB) = 0.0008% measured with a 1kHz -20dBu input signal and with a 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* Frequency response at minimum gain (0dB) = -0.5dB down at 10Hz and 3dB down at 110kHz
* Frequency response at maximum gain (60dB) = 3dB down at 16Hz and 3dB down 85kHz
* CMRR=91.8dB (Channel 1, 1kHz, maxiumum gain)
* Crosstalk Channel to Channel: with 10dB@1kHz input to chA, chB output =102dBrA. With 10dB@10kHz input to chA,
* chB output = 84dBrA

'''Line Input Response'''
* Gain range = -20dB to +10dB in 10dB steps
* Input Impedance = 10k
* Ohms from 10Hz to 200kHz
* Noise at main output with gain at unity (0dB) = -96dBu measured with a 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* Signal-to-noise ratio relative to max headroom (24dBu)=120dB
* Signal-to-noise ratio relative to 0dBFS(+22dBu) = 118dB
* THD at unity gain (0dB) = 0.001% measured with a 0dBu input signal and with a 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* Frequency Response at unity gain (0dB) = 0.3dB down at 10Hz and 3dB down at 122kHz

'''Instrument Input Response'''
* Gain range = 10dB to 40dB continuously variable
* Input Impedance:
* High >1M Ohms
* Low > 300k Ohms
* Noise at minimum gain (+10dB) = -90dBu measured with a 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* Noise at maximum gain (+40dB) = -62dBu measured with a 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* THD at minimum gain (+10dB) = 0.002% measured with a 10dBu input signal and with a 22Hz/22kHz bandpass filter
* Frequency Response at 10dB gain with -10dB input = 10Hz-200kHz Â± 0.6dB
* Frequency Response at 40dB gain with -40dB input = -2.5dB down at 10Hz and 0dB at 200kHz

'''High Pass Filter'''
* Roll off = 18dB per octave 3 pole filter
* Fixed Frequency 75Hz measured at the 3dB down point

'''Input Meter'''
* Calibrated in the detent position for 0dBFS = +22dBu and indicates the level after the High Pass Filter and before the
* Insert Send output. LED levels are as follows:
* 0 = +22dBu
* -2 = +20dBu
* -6 = +16dBu
* -12 = +10dBu
* -18 = +4dBu
* -42 = -20dBu
* Calibration is adjustable to allow 0dBFS to equal +10dBu to +26dBu
