== Guidelines and considerations ==


To get a good sound, whether for pop or classical, it is usual to combine a closer direct micing setup with room [[microphone]]s, and if you have multiple sections to use stereo sectional pickups. It really depends on the room you have to record in and the sound you wish to achieve, directional micing like for any sound source provides you with greater flexibility later, (more control over individual instrument volume as well as the ability to apply a reverb. However if you are in a good room with trained musicians, room microphones can provide a great stereo picture and an accurate respresentation of the live sound, and feel of the room. In general a good room is one that is highly reflective with a good amount of wood on the floor and walls, with few dampening panels.


=== Size of Arrangements ===



Most common setups are Quartet (2 violins, viola and cello), 10 person group (4 violins, 3 viola's, 2 cello's, 1 bass), and larger but the ratio's remain similar.

In a good room, Decca Tree, or AB Stereo Microphone Technique will get a great stereo picture with a good deal room sound. If you have a somewhat dead room, but still want to grab a bit of the sound on a smaller ensemble like a quartet XY Stereo Microphone Technique can sound good.

----


String instruments are designed in such a way that the body of the instrument vibrates and focuses the sound out of the F hole. 18-28" out from the f hole using a decent quality [[condenser microphone]] with a [[polar pattern|cardioid pattern]] should get you a good sound. However a lot of people favor ribbon or tube microphones on strings.
