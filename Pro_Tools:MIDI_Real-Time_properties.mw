==Pro Tools MIDI realtime properties==

[[MIDI]] real-time properties let you change certain MIDI properties of a MIDI track, Instrument track or MIDI region in real time without changing the actual data on the track itself. Once Real-time property settings are established, you can write them to the track (changing the MIDI data) if you ''choose''

The types of MIDI Real-time properties available to Pro Tools are [[Quantization (music)|Quantize]],Duration,Delay,Velocity and Transpose.
