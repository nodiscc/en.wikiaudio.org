'''instructions:'''


This little piece of code was done using DEV C++. 

To use in DEV C++ you first need to go to the linker and type in   '''-lwinmm'''  for it to work. (images below) 




Compile the code and run. Then tap the Q key for one sound, and any other key for the other sound. 

Modify code to do your bidding. Experiment and have fun.




'''Note:''' There is a horrible delay when triggering the sounds. :(
