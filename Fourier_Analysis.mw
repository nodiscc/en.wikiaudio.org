'''Fourier analysis''', named after Joseph Fourier's introduction of the Fourier series, is the decomposition of a function in terms of a sum of sinusoidal functions (called basis functions) of different frequencies that can be recombined to obtain the original function. The recombination process is called Fourier synthesis (in which case, Fourier analysis refers specifically to the decomposition process).
