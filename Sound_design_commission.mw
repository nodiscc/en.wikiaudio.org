The '''Sound Design Commission''' is a society which assists and promotes theatrical technical professions in the United States. It is one of the newest Commissions created by the USITT (United States Institute for Theatre Technology) within their working groups. In 1980 it appeared as the "Lighting and Sound Design Commission" and the two groups met and worked together for several years until the Sound Design members dramatically outnumbered the Lighting Design members and the Commission was split into two. The first Sound Design Commissioner was Charlie Richmond who served from 1980 through 1988. It remains one of the most active Commissions within the USITT.
