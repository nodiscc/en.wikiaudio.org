==F Major==
        

#Place your index finger so that it covers both the 2nd and 1st strings on the first fret.
#Place your middle finger on the 3rd string, 2nd fret
#Place your ring finger on the 4th string, 3rd fret
#Start from the 4th string and strum each of the strings below in quick succession. Do not play the 6th or 5th strings.

The F Major Chord is similar in shape to the C Major chord
in that it looks much like a staircase, expect for the fact that most
of the notes in the F Major chord are moved down one string. Besides
the similarity of their shapes, the F and C chords are relatively easy
to move between and can be found together in many different musical
patterns.
