== Guidelines and considerations ==

*The sound of the saxophone emanates from every hole in the instrument in completley different proportions for each note.

*Don't mic  the bell directly if you want a full sounding instrument with the higher frequency elements. Miking the bell directly will sound "stuffy".



==Microphone placement==
