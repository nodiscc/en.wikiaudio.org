[[Image:Pro Tools edit modes.png]]


The edit modes are in the upper left hand corner of the edit window. These modes determine how [[audio]] and [[MIDI]] regions are moved and edited.

===Shuffle===
This mode allows you to move regions in a manner where they automatically snap back-to-back without space between them or overlapping. This is used to rearrange adjacent parts of the session. 

===Spot===
This mode allows you to move,place or trim regions to specific destinations using numerical values.

===Slip===
This mode allows you to move regions freely without affecting other regions

===Grid===
This mode allows you to snap regions and MIDI notes to a time increment on a grid that is based off the selected  time scale.
