== Music Theory ==



'''Music theory''' is the field of study that deals with the mechanics of music and how music works. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques. In a more general sense, music theory also often distills and analyzes the elements of music â€“ rhythm, harmony (harmonic function), melody, structure, form, and texture. Broadly, theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music (Boretz, 1995). People who study these properties are known as music theorists.
