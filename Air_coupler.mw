An '''air coupler''' is a type of [[woofer]] speaker system that entails mounting a woofer into a wall with the speaker "side" facing the wall. The speaker is placed between two wall studs.  A rectangular hole is then cut into the wall about 8 feet above or below the speaker to let the sound out. 
Air coupler speaker systems were popular among many audiophiles in the 1950's.
