* Includes 48 presets.

* Multiple-Mode Filter that includes LP (Low pass), BP (Band pass), HP (High pass), notch, peak, low pass and high pass shelving filter with adjustable cutoff and bandwidth. The values are automatically computed when you select any of the filter types. 

* ADSR envelope generator with Attack, Sustain, Decay and Release parameters and several modulation targets. 

* Multisampled Strings Ensemble: Violin, Viola, Cello, Double Bass. 

* Full length sustain samples, no loops (natural decay), stored in 16 bits and 44.100 KHz, providing superb detail for the musician. 

* GLIDE control: affects pitch transitions. When turned to the far left, there are no pitch transitions - new notes immediately play at their "correct" pitch. If turned to the right, the glide time increases - new notes are triggered at the pitch of the previous note, and then gradually glide to the pitch of the played note, quickly or slowly, depending on the setting of this knob. 

* MIDI Automation: Added complete MIDI CC#.
