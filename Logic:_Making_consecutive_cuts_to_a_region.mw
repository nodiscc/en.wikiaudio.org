'''1.''' Select a region 

'''2.''' Select the scissor tool  (you can do this via key command '''ESC''')

'''3.''' Hold down '''Option''' and make a cut to the region. The region should be cut consecutively. The cuts are based on the current quantization value. If the procedure doesn't seem to work, or works at a grid value other than what you want, choose a quantization value that corresponds to the cut you are trying to make.


The end result should look similar to the image below
