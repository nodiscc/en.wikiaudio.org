A '''terminal''' is a conductive device for joining [[electrical circuit]]s together. The connection may be temporary, as for portable equipment, or may require a tool for assembly and removal, or may be a permanent electrical joint between two wires or devices. 

Terminals form a single circuit, unlike [[electrical connector]]s, which form two or more circuits.
