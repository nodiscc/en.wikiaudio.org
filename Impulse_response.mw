Impulse response can refer to one of two definitions.

#Acoustic sample used for realistic acoustic reproduction (such as used with convolution reverb )
#A measurement of sound pressure versus time.

An impulse response (IR) is the output of a system/room when excited by an impulse. Mathematically an impulse is a (ideal) signal of a infinite short duration, which correspond in the frequency domain to a signal of an infinite wide frequency range. 

In room acoustic, an impulse is used, or derived from other signals, to estimate the acoustic response of environments.
