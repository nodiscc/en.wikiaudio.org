In physics, wavelength is the distance between repeating units of a propagating wave of a given frequency. It is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (λ).


== Calculating Wavelength ==

Wavelength is calculated using The equation V=fλ

V = Velocity of the wave (The speed of sound in dry air at 1 atmosphere pressure and 0˚C is 331.4 m/s<ref>Applied Mathematical & Physical Formulas Vokota Boljanovic.Page 347. ISBN 0831133090</ref>)

f = Frequency

λ = Wavelength
