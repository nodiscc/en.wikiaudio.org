The '''Moog Polymoog''' is a fully [[polyphony|polyphonic]] analog [[synthesizer]] created between 1975-1980. There are two versions of the synthesizer, the 203a synthesizer version and the 280a keyboard version. The main difference between the two versions was the synthesizer had more options and the keyboard had more presets, including the vox humana preset used by Gary Numan. The earlier serial numbers of the Moog Polymoog were noted as prone to repair, but as the production went on and the modifications were made to them they got better. Some were even taken back to the factory, refurbished and put back into sale as a updated version. 

Another main difference between the two versions was the power supply. The synthesizer had a Faratron power supply, where the keyboard version had a Moog made power supply deemed much more stable. The Faratron power supply was thought to be a main cause in some of the overheating issues of the Polymoog.
