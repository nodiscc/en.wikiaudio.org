'''MOTM''' is the name of a modular synthesizer system manufactured by Synthesis Technologies.



== History ==

The MOTM system was created in 1998, and production continues


== Specifications ==
It uses a +-15 volt power supply for most modules, with a +5 volt power supply also required for some digital modules. The audio signals are the standard +-5 volts, peak to peak. Al of the modules use 1/4" jacks for audio/CV signals. The modules are all "5U" (1U being 1.75") high, and multiples of 1U wide. MOTM modules can be mounted in a standard 19" rack with MOTM rails, or can be mounted in custom cabinets, etc.


== Frac Rack ==
In early 2006, The "Frac Rack" series of modules were released, using 3.5mm jacks and a smaller overall form factor to fit in with PAiA Electronics and Blacet modular systems.


== Modules ==
The Modules are divided into categories, based on their function.
