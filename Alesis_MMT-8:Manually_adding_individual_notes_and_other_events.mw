An event can be added by using the COPY button. Pressing and holding '''COPY''' opens a display that says '''INSERT NOTE AT 001/00'''.
Pressing the '''RECORD''' button would insert C3, a velocity of 64, and a duration of 1 beat. You could then change these values by using the '''EDIT''' feature and editing this event.


If you would like to insert an event other than a '''NOTE'''. you can do this by Holding the '''COPY''' button and using the pge up and down buttons to choose different events.
