'''Advanced Intelligent Tape (AIT)''' is a high-speed, high-capacity magnetic tape data storage format developed and controlled by Sony. It competes mainly against the DLT, LTO, DAT/DDS, and VXA formats. AIT uses a cassette similar to Video8. Super AIT (SAIT) is a higher capacity variant using wider tape in a larger, single-spool cartridge. Both AIT and SAIT use the helical scan method of reading and writing the tape.
