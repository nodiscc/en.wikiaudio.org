To loop a region in [[Reaper]]:

If the imported file is already edited to the correct length then simply  '''left-click''' the edge of the region and drag.

If the area to be looped needs to be edited out of an existing region then follow these steps:

*First edit  the (region to) loop to the size you want. You can do this by splitting the region (Key command '''S''' or to split at locators use '''Shift-S''')
*Then right click the edited region and choose '''Glue selected items'''.
*Place the cursor at either end of the region and '''left-click''' and drag to create the loop.
