===Using Flex Tool===

The flex tool allows for the [[time compression]] and expansion of specific areas of a region such as transients. This allows for easy movement to a specific time reference.

'''1.''' Select the track with the audio file(s) you want to affect

'''2.''' On the track choose the "flex type" by clicking and holding on the menu in the track header (image below)

'''3.''' A window will appear with a choice of a few different algorithms called "'''flex modes'''"(such as rhythmic, [[Polyphony|polyphonic]], [[monophonic]] etc) pick the one that reflects the qualities of the audio region the most.

'''4.''' Click and hold the part of the audio file you want to expand or compress and move it to where you want it to land relative to the time grid.




===Flex view===

You can enable a feature called '''Flex view''' that allows a simplified way to see and add transient markers (these are the focal points of movement when you time compress or expand using the flex tool)

To enable Flex view select the region you want to enable, then go to '''View / Flex view'''

===Transient detection editing in the sample editor===
To edit the transient detection in the sample editor simply double click on an audio region and in the sample editor click the transient detection option and then click the '''+''' and '''-''' icons next to it. (image below)
