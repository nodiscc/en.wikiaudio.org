'''Step 1'''. 

Set an audio track (or audio instruments)  output to '''Binaural'''.



'''Step 2'''. 

Double  click the panning icon.This will open the pan display window. You need  to enable the doppler setting and turn up the size setting. 


'''Step 3'''.

Now to hear the effect, all you need to do is play an audio file and move the center pan icon. (image below)
