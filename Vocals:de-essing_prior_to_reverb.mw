This is a technique to add reverb processing that doesn't accentuate sibilance to a vocal track.

'''1.''' Split the vocal track to two channels

'''2.''' Use a de-esser on one of them and send ''that'' one to a reverb unit (and remove it from the stereo mix)

'''3.''' Mix the processed vocal back in with the dry vocal.
