The '''absolute threshold''' of hearing (ATH) is the minimum sound level of a pure tone that an average ear with normal hearing can hear in a noiseless environment. The absolute threshold relates to the sound that can just be heard by the organism (Durrant & Lovrinic 1984, Gelfand 2004). The absolute threshold is not a discrete point, and is therefore classed as the point at which a response is elicited a specified percentage of the time (Durrant & Lovrinic 1984).
