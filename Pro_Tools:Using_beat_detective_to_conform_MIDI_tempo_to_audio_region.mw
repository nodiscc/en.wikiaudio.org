If you add an audio file that is tempo or rhythm based and would like to conform the MIDI tempo of your session to "fit" the region follow these steps



Make sure the [[Pro Tools: Changing time display rulers|bar ruler displays bars and beats or whatever respective time value is necessary]]




In the image below we have a drum file that is 2 bars long but the MIDI tempo of Pro Tools is different than our file, hence it doesn't correlate with the bar and beats ruler

We are going to change this using beat detective by changing the MIDI tempo of the session.


Select Beat detective

'''Event / Beat Detective'''

Select the region and in beat detective set the start and end points of where it ''should'' fit.

Then click '''analyze'''

Then click '''generate'''

The end result should be a MIDI tempo  or tempo change that accomodates the audio region and conforms to the settings made in beat detective.

In this example the MIDI tempo changed to conform to an audio file that was 2 bars long
