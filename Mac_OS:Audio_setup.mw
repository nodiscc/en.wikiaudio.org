Once open, choose the '''Audio Devices tab'''



==Default inputs and Outputs==

These are the default inputs and outputs that the Mac OS will read and send signal from. When you launch a DAW program such as Logic or Pro Tools, the internal hardware driver settings of the software will (usually) take precedence over these settings. 

==Clock source==

This is used to determine what device is the [[Word clock|digital clock]] source.
