The '''parametric array''' is a nonlinear transducer|transduction mechanism that generates narrow, nearly sidelobe free beams of low frequency sound, through the mixing and interaction of high frequency [[sound wave]]s, effectively overcoming the [[diffraction limit]] (a kind of spatial 'uncertainty principle') associated with linear acoustics.<ref>[http://asa.aip.org/books/nonlinear.html#Preface1 Nonlinear Acoustics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Parametric arrays can be formed in water<ref>[http://asa.aip.org/books/nonuw.html Nonlinear Underwater Acoustics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, air<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.384959],</ref>, and earth materials/rock.<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.403453],</ref> <ref>[http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/ees/ees11/geophysics/nonlinear/pubs/parabeam.html].</ref>
