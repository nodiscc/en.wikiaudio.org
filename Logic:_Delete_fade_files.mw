Sometimes in [[Logic]] the fade files get corrupted adding undesirable pops and clicks to the end of audio regions in the arrange window. Sometimes deleting the fade files can remedy this.

To delete fade files:

Go to '''Options / Audio / Delete All Fade Files'''.

To refresh the fade files after deletion, simply play the session from the beginning.
