The Impulse drum sampler can load up to 8 samples that can be  triggered via a keyboard controller, the keys on your keyboard, or a MIDI clip.

==Impulse==


You can add audio files to any of the 8 drum pads by simply dragging and dropping the files to them.
You can also [[Ableton Live:Impulse drum module edit and adding of files|edit files in Lives arrange window and then add them to the impulse.]]






Most of the parameters (except the three on the right most side) affect whatever individual pad is selected.The three on the right side affect the entire module.

==Drum Pads==
The drum pads have 4 buttons attached to them. (image below) 

[[File:Ableton Live impulse drum pad features.png]]


====Mute====
Mutes the pad

====Play====
Plays the sample

====Solo====
Solos the pad

====Swap sample====
Allows the user to swap the sample using Abletons browser window




==Sample specific parameters==

===Start===

This is a start attack time 

====Soft====

This "softens" the start time (attack) of the audio

===Transp===

This transposes the selected pad

====Velocity====

This changes the speed of the sample based on how fast you play a note.

====Random====
This is a random velocity setting. It's similar to the '''Velocity''' setting only it is random and not set

===Stretch===

This is a time stretch setting.It changes the playback length of the sample assigned to the selected pad.

====Velocity====

This changes the time stretch based on the velocity of the notes played. This value can be negative which means if you hit the note quietly it will stretch more. 

====Mode====

'''A''' and '''B''' modes are program defined processing algorithms. A is considered better for low frequency material and B is better for high frequency material.

===Drive===

Drive is a distortion effect . It is only active when the '''Sat''' button is enabled

====Sat====

The '''Sat''' button is short for '''''Saturation'''''. This enables the drive effect.

===Freq===

This is the frequency selector for the impulse filter. This can only be used after turning on the '''Filter''' button below it.

====Filter====

This is the on/off switch for the impulse filter

====Mode====

[[File:Ableton Live impulse drum module filter modes.png]]

The Mode is the ''type'' of filter that is assigned to Impulse.

The options are LP1,LP2,BP1,BP2,HP1,HP2 and Notch.

=====LP1 & LP2=====

'''LP''' stands for Low Pass and '''LP2''' is a more aggressive (lower) low pass filter than '''LP1'''.

=====BP1 & BP2=====

'''BP''' stands for Band Pass. '''BP2''' is a more aggressive filter than '''BP1'''

===Res===
'''
Res''' is short for resonance and is the bandwidth of the filter 

====Velocity====

This allows you to affect the filter based on how hard (or soft) the notes being triggered play.

====Random====

 
This allows you to affect the filter based on how hard (or soft) the notes being triggered play in a random unpredictable manner


===Decay===
This is a decay setting. 

=====Trigger / Gate=====

This determines if the decay "cuts off" when the sample is re-triggered.If it's set to trigger it won't cut off, if it's set to gate it will cut off.

===Pan===

This pans the sample left or right.

=====Velocity=====

This makes the panning of the sample dependent on how fast the note is played.

=====Random=====

This is similar to velocity only the effects are not predictable. The panning is random.

===Volume===
This is the volume of the sample.

=====Velocity=====

This makes the volume of the sample dependent on how fast or slow it's triggered.

=====M=====

This Mutes the sample

=====S=====

This Solo's the sample



==Module's global parameters==

[[File:Ableton Live impulse module global parameters.png]]





===Volume===

This changes the volume of all sounds on all pads

===Time===

This changes the length (time) of all sounds on all pads

===Transpose===

This transposes the pitch of all sounds on all pads
