A '''point source''' is a single identifiable localized source of something. A point source has negligible extent, distinguishing it from other source geometries. Sources are called point sources because in mathematical modeling, these sources can usually be approximated as a mathematical point to simplify analysis.



== Radio waves ==



Radio wave sources which are smaller than one radio wavelength are also generally treated as point sources. Radio emissions generated by a fixed electrical circuit are usually polarized, producing anisotropic radiation. If the propagating medium is lossless, however, the radiant power in the radio waves at a given distance will still vary as the inverse square of the distance if the angle remains constant to the source polarization.

'''Examples:'''

* Radio antennas are often smaller than one wavelength, even though they are many metres across
* Pulsars are treated as point sources when observed using radio telescopes

== Sound ==



Sound is an oscillating pressure wave. As the pressure oscillates up and down, an audio point source acts in turn as a fluid point source and then a fluid point sink. (Such an object does not exist physically, but is often a good simplified model for calculations.)

* Seismic vibration from a localised seismic experiment searching for oil
* Noise pollution from a jet engine in a large-scale study of noise pollution
* A loudspeaker may be considered as a point source in a study of the acoustics of airport announcements
