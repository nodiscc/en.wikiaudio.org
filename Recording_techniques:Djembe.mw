==General guidelines==

*The head of Djembes is pretty wide and some of the bass comes from the bottom of the instrument.

*There isn't a single position close to the drum that captures it's actual sound.So a realistic recording requires some distance between the microphone(s) and the instrument.



----
===Microphone Placement===
'''Each technique begins with a bullet point.'''

*In a good sounding room try micing the drum 6-10 feet away.
*If you wish to close mic, try a single mic 4-6 inches above the rim and angled across the drum head.
*To capture the extra low frequencies place a microphone underneath the instrument and aimed at the opening.
*Combine these techniques to get a fairly accurate sound (large diaphragm dynamic microphone underneath the instrument and small condenser microphone above the rim).
