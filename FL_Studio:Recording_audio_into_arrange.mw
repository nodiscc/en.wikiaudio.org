After you record you can decide which mixer channel to send the audio file to by double clicking it and 
choosing SMP from the window that appears, and then set the FX number to the channel you want to send the audio to. This isn't specifically an effects send, it's a channel assignment even though the FX label may have you assume otherwise.
