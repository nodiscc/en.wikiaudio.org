The '''Roland JV-1080''' (aka Super JV-1080, or simply 1080) is a Sample-based synthesizer/sound module in the form of a 2U rack design. It was the most popular synthesizer, not only from Roland, but in the history of synthesizers.



== Features ==


The JV-1080 features a 64-Voice Polyphony, as well as 16-part Multi-timbral capabilities. From the factory, the JV-1080 comes with hundreds of patches, and several rhythm kits (8 Mega-Bytes total). It can be expanded with 4 SR-JV80 expansion cards, as well as a PCM and Data card, to provide up to 42 Mega-Bytes.
