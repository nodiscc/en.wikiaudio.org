The term '''uaser''' is the term coined for an ultrasonic laser. Like its quantum mechanical counterparts, lasers and masers, the acronym uaser (pronouned way-zer) stands for ultrasound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation

Sound is a classical system (see continuum mechanics), and so the coherent structure in the case of the uaser is coherent in the sense of distributions. The technique, which is still in its infancy, is accomplished by synchronizing the frequency of piezoelectric transducers. The stimulated emission in the case of the uaser is a power law amplification in the output signal of the acoustic beam.
