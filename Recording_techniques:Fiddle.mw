==Microphone placement==
'''Each technique begins with a bullet point.'''

*Position a mic about 6 feet in front of the violin and slightly above the instrument to capture a full body sound with little bow effect.

*Try placing a mic underneath the instrument in addition to any microphones placed above it.

*For close micing place a [[ribbon microphone]] over the players shoulder

*Have the violinist play in the corner of the studio/room and place the microphone about 3 feet out and 2 feet above the instrument
