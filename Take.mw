A '''take''' is a single continuous recorded performance. The term is used in film and music to denote and track the stages of production.

In music, a take similarly refers to successive attempts to record a song or part. Musical takes are also sequentially numbered. The need to obtain a complete, acceptable take was especially important in the years predating multi-track recording and overdubbing techniques.
