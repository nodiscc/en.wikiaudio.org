==G Major==
       

#Place your middle finger on the 6th string, 3rd fret
#Place your index finger on the 5th string, 2nd fret
#Place your ring finger on the 1st string, 3rd fret
#Strum all of the strings in quick succession





The G Major chord can be played with a few different fingerings, although the one
described above is the easiest for beginning players. An alternate
fingering would be to use your ring finger to play the first note, your
middle finger to play the second, and your pinkie to play the final
note.
