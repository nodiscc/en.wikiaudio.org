You must first understand basic HTML to understand the DOM.

==What is the DOM?==

*'''DOM''' stands for '''Document Object Model''' and it is a representation of the entire html page as a series of nodes and attributes. In HTML-speak this also include all "tags" I.E.  <nowiki><div>, <ul>, <span> <tr></nowiki>... etc.


*You can access any of these nodes and change,add and remove them.You can also change,add and remove attributes of them.

==The Dom Tree==

The browser sees the document as a nested list of notes,attributes and child nodes. A node can be anything. It can be an element,a text,a comment or anything else.


==DOM retrieval methods==

There are two ways to retrieve elements from the DOM. They are:

*'''document.getElementByID(ID)'''
''returns the element with the ID.''

*'''document.getElementByTagName(name)'''
''returns an <u>array</u> of all the elements with the name.''


===Storing in variables===

You can assign variables to the DOM "'''getElementBy'''" retrieval methods.

''Example:''
''This assigns x to an element with the '''id''' of '''nav'''''

'''x = document.getElementById('nav');'''





===getElementByTagName stores in an array===

Since '''getElementTagName''' stores elements in an array, the elements are accessed starting at 0. <u>Computers start counting at 0</u>, unlike humans which start counting at 1.

===nextSibling & previousSibling===

You can use '''nestSibling''' and '''previousSibling''' to choose the next or previous element in the
'''getElementByTagName''' array. 


===parentNode===

You can reach the element that the current one is embedded in using '''parentNode'''.

===childNodes===
If an element contains other elements then these elements are its children. 

===Node properties===
====nodeType====
====nodeName====
====nodeValue====
