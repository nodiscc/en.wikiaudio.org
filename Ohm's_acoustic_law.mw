'''Ohm's acoustic law''', sometimes called the '''acoustic phase law''' or simply '''Ohm's law''', states that a musical sound is perceived by the ear as a set of a number of constituent pure harmonic tones.<ref>Ohm's law, ''n''.2, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed.</ref><ref>A. Wilmer Duff, editor (1912). A Text-book of Physics.</ref>

The law was proposed by physicist Georg Ohm in 1843.<ref>Ohm, G., ''Annalen der Physik'' (1843) 59 513</ref> Hermann von Helmholtz elaborated the law into what is often today known as Ohm's acoustic law, by adding that the quality of a tone depends solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple tones, and not on their relative phases.<ref>Dayton Clarence Miller (1916).

London: Macmillan and Co. Ltd.</ref>  Helmholtz championed the law in opposition to contrary evidence expounded by [[August Seebeck]].<ref>Joseph Peterson (1908).

The law has also been interpreted as "a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustical wave contains power at that frequency."<ref>David M. Howard, Jamie A. S. Angus (2006). Acoustics and psychoacoustics. Focal Press. p. 123. ISBN 9780240519951.</ref>

These laws are known to be not quite true. In modern times, the sensitivity of human hearing to the phase of tone components has been extensively investigated.<ref>John Borwick (2001). Loudspeaker and Headphone Handbook. Focal Press. ISBN 0240515781.</ref>Limitations have led to this characterization:<ref>W. Dixon Ward (1970). "Musical Perception". in Jerry V. Tobias. Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory. 1. Academic Press. p. 438.</ref>

<small>  ''For years musicians have been told that the ear is able to separate any complex signal into a series of sinusoidal signals – that is acts as a Fourier analyzer. This quarter-truth, known as Ohm's Other Law, has served to increase the distrust with which perceptive musicians regard scientists, since it is readily apparent to them that the ear acts in this way only under very restricted conditions.''
—W. Dixon Ward (1970) </small>

Ohm's acoustic law is not related to his more famous electrical law, called ''Ohm's law''.
