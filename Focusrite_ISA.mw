'''High Pass Filter'''
* Roll off: 18dB per octave 3 pole filter
* Fixed Frequency 75Hz measured at the 3dB down point

'''Meters'''
* Moving coil (MC) meter is factory calibrated to 0VU: +4dBu with 1kHz sinewave. With the VU Cal button pressed the meter can be adjusted on the rear panel to allow 0VU to equal +10dBu to +26dBu with the centre detent being equal to +22dBu.
* Peak LED meters calibrated in the detent position for 0dBFS: +22dBu, calibration is adjustable on the rear panel to allow 0dBFS to equal +10dBu to +26dBu
* Routing for MC and Peak1 meter is after the HPF, pre insert send or switched post insert return. Peak2 is always pre ADC channel 2, which can be fed by external input or Instrument input.
* LED levels are as follows when peak calibration is set to center detent on the rear panel. (This is when using the internal ADC).

0: +22dBu
* -2: +20dBu
* -6: +16dBu
* -12: +10dBu
* -18: +4dBu
* -42: -20dBu
