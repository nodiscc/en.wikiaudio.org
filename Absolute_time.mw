'''Absolute time''' (also called '''ABS,ABS-Time and A-Time''') is a time count in a DAW or other recorder that advances along with the audio. The time count usually starts at 00:00:00 at the beginning of the digital audio medium or tape and advances in real time as the medium is played and/or recorded to. Absolute time is not the same thing as SMPTE time code. <ref>The Audio Dictionary. Page 3. ISBN 0295984988</ref>
