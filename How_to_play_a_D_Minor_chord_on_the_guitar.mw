*Place your index finger on the 1st string, 1st fret
*Place your middle finger on the 3rd string, 2nd fret

*Start from the 4th string and strum each of the strings below in quick succession. Do not play either the 6th or 5th strings.



The D Minor Chordis one that many guitar players have trouble wrapping their headsaround (maybe because it inverts the sharp of the D Major chord). Spendsome time with this one until you play it well.
