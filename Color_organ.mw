The term '''color organ''' refers to a tradition of mechanical (18th century), then electromechanical, devices built to represent sound or to accompany music in a visual mediumâ€”by any number of means. In the early 20th century, a silent color organ tradition (Lumia) developed. In the 60s and 70s, the term 'color organ' became popularly associated with electronic devices that responded to their music inputs with light shows. The term 'light organ' is increasingly being used for these devices; allowing 'color organ' to reassume its original meaning.
