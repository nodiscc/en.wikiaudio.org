==The Facility==
 
===Tracking Rooms===

The 450 sq ft Tracking room is red oak with walnut trim, and features 14 foot vaulted ceiling, and many fine vintage instruments.
The tracking room is designed with sight lines and comfort of the musicians as the priority. We believe that if musicians playing together as a performance is what you do, then you should have a recording   experience that is conducive to that same experience. The main isolation  booth is finished in eastern red cedar, and is  suitable for isolation  of any instrument and exceptional for VO work.
 
===Control Room===

The 350 sq ft control room finish is cherry with red oak trim. Acoustics of the room are +/-3db from 20Hz to 20kHz, and can easily accommodate a full production crew and band members. The control room is appointed  with both state of the art and classic  equipment technology. It features a spacious console area and producer's  desk that allow plenty  of space to work on your project.
Engineers will appreciate the ergonomic environment. Everything you need is available from within the sweet spot.
Producer's will appreciate the large workspace within the sweet spot and access to the rest of the facility, without having to disturb the engineer.

With many professional video services within the region, we can work  with any services you desire - from single camera documentary filming, to full broadcast prep/post.
