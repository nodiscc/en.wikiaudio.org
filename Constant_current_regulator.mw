A '''Constant current regulator''' is a device that regulates current delivery, limiting it to a constant value.
These are used with long tail pairs, series lighting strings, some LED lighting, and some other applications.
Some IC (integrated circuit) regulators are designed to be used as either constant voltage or constant current devices.
