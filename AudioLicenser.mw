AudioLicenser.com ([http://www.audiolicenser.com]) is an online digital music licensing marketplace. It was founded in August 2014 by Fort Thomas, KY native, Ian Herzog. This marketplace has a growing library of royalty free music and stock audio. The library consists of several musicians, composers, copyright owners who have created portfolios of their work, offering them for immediate licensing and download through the AudioLicenser website. 

Anyone who owns the rights to their music can join the AudioLicenser contributor community and start selling. To do so, an account is required. As of this post (February 28, 2015) the only option for contributors is to be non-exclusive, meaning they can license their music elsewhere. Non-exclusive contributors make 50% of every license purchased of their work. 

The library is small but growing, and AudioLicenser invites anyone who owns high quality music of any genre to join the community.
