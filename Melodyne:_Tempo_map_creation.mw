===Melodyne 3.2.2: Making a Tempo Map===

This tutorial uses Melodyne version 3.2.2.

A  [[tempo map]] is used to sync midi tempo information with variable tempo audio material.


== Open the arrangement editor ==



1. First Import or record your audio into Melodyne and open the arrangement editor. The image below is of a 4/4 4 bar drum performance that has a fill at the beginning and small fluctuations in tempo

== Line up Tempo Markers ==


Now click on the bar line that is closest to the down beat of the audio. In our case it's bar 2 on the time display. Once you click you should see a blue line appear. Click and hold the blue line and move it to the down beat of the audio. In our case we have a fill before the down beat so we are going to put the blue line after the fill.

'''Before    '''      and       '''   After    '''

Now you simply need to continue repeating this pattern for evey bar of the audio material.


'''Before'''

'''After'''

The end result in our case would look like the image below.

Notice the tempo changes between bars
