== Memristor ==
 
'''Memristor'''  (a portmanteau of "memory resistor") is a passive two-terminal electrical component envisioned as a fundamental non-linear circuit element relating charge and magnetic flux linkage. The memristor is currently under development by a team at Hewlett Packard.It's practical uses encompass much faster computation and more robust non volatile  based memory storage of digital data than previous methods.
