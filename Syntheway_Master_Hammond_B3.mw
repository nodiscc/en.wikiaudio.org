<big>'''Specifications'''</big>
* Modeled on mastered samples (normalized and noise-reduced). Based on PCM recordings of a Hammond B3 organ with full length sustain samples, no loops (natural decay), stored in 16 bits and 44.100 KHz. 

* ADSR envelope generator with Attack, Sustain, Decay and Release parameters and several modulation targets. 

* Leslie Rotary Speaker Cabinet emulation is included in some presets with embedded effect. 

* Portamento/Glide control:  affects pitch transitions. A gliding effect that allows a sound to change pitch at a gradual rate, rather than abruptly, when a new key is pressed or MIDI note sent. 

* Reverb built-in: free variation of acoustic ambience thanks to complete separation of organ and room. Small rooms can be modeled just as accurately as larger spaces. 

* MIDI Automation: Added complete MIDI CC#.
