'''Manley Laboratories, Inc.''' in recent years has expanded and thrived under EveAnna Manley's leadership. Manley's 11,000 sq. ft. building houses its own machine shop, printed circuit board manufacture, audio transformer winding, engraving, and silk-screening facilities. All custom design, R&D, assembly, testing, and quality control processes are performed with precision and pride at the Manley factory, located just 35 miles east of Los Angeles. All MANLEY and LANGEVIN products are built in Chino, not China. Manley Labs also proudly manufacture George Massenburg's legendary GML recording equipment.

The MANLEY brand has been around since the late 1980's. Manley's first commercially available products were upper echelon high-fidelity vacuum tube amplifiers and preamplifiers constructed at the old Vacuum Tube Logic of America factory. On January 30, 1989, a 20 year old EveAnna Dauray on sabbatical from her studies at Columbia University met the crew and was hired on to the production team. Baltazar Hernandez, already with two years experience, taught her how to solder in those first few days. It was in 1989 that the first Manley professional products were developed, starting with the original 1u Reference 60dB Microphone Preamplifier and soon followed by the Manley Enhanced Pultec and Mid Frequency Equalizers. Baltazar and EveAnna, busy building gear, were soon joined by brothers Saulo and Ramiro Montalvo. Just next door, Elias Guzman was employed by a printed circuit board maker later brought into the Manley Labs fold when in 1993, Manley Laboratories, Inc. became a separate entity apart from VTL. The new Manley Labs factory at 13880 Magnolia Ave. in Chino, California was outfitted to house the Manley HiFi and Pro Studio manufacturing as well as the Langevin production lines, a newly acquired machine shop, and printed circuit board facilities. 

Manley Labs takes a purist approach to everything it builds; refining, executing, and expanding upon Manley's legacy of vacuum tube design philosophies proven over years of real-world experience, using high quality modern components, many of which are fabricated in-house. This attention to detail delivers the rich, present, and natural sound their vacuum tube designs are renowned for. Never small, sterile, or boring. Beyond this, Manley means reliability, real technical support, and a company attitude that professionals depend on. Customer service is handled by Paul Fargo who has been with the company since the mid-1990's.

Langevin is a legendary marque of premium electronics whose lineage goes back to World War II. MANLEY acquired the LANGEVIN brand name in the early 1990's from the Mark IV Audio Group. None of the old products were replicated and instead new discrete solid-state designs were developed. The Langevin products are built alongside and to the same exacting standards as the Manley equipment.
