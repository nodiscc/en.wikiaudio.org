A person who practices the art of sonoplastia is known as a sonoplasta.


== Theatre ==



Working with the director the sonoplasta develops an overall concept for the sound aesthetic, creating dramatic links between characters, locations and objects through sound elements, and broadens the emotional dimension of the play through the subtle transformation of the sound material, providing a physical reality for the production, an environment, a cohesive logical world, real or imagined for the play to inhabit.
