<b>Polarity reversal </b>(also known as <i>polarity inversion, phase reversal, phase-flipping</i>) is the act of inverting the polarity of an electrical signal. After polarity reversal, a positive voltage will have been inverted to be negative by the same value. 

Most audio equipment will have a switch to engage polarity reversal, often labelled with the latin character Ã˜.
