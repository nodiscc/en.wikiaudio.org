A '''loudspeaker''', or speaker system is an electromechanical transducer that converts an electrical signal to sound. The term loudspeaker can refer to individual devices (otherwise known as drivers), or to complete systems consisting of a enclosure incorporating one or more drivers and additional electronic components. Loudspeakers, as with other electro-acoustic transducers, are the most variable elements in an audio system and are responsible for the greatest degree of audible differences between sound systems.
