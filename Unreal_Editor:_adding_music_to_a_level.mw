'''Pequisites'''
#This tutorial already assumes you know how to build basic levels.
#The file you wish to add must be in Ogg format and must be placed in the UnrealEd Music folder directly (not a subfolder)
----


While having a map open push '''F6'''.This will bring up the level properties.

Now go to '''Level Properties / Audio / Song''' and type in the name of your song (without the file extension). Save your map.

You can now play it with music triggers in the '''Actor Class browser/Triggers'''.
