The '''Yamaha CS-80''' was a polyphonic analog synthesizer released in 1977. It sported true 8-voice polyphony (with two independent synthesizer layers per voice) as well as a primitive (sound) settings memory based on a bank of micropotentiometers (rather than the digital programmable presets the Prophet-5 would sport soon after), and exceptionally complete performer expression features, such as a splittable keyboard that was both velocity-sensitive (like a piano's) and pressure-sensitive ("after-touch") but unlike most modern keyboards the aftertouch could be applied to individual voices rather than in common, and a ribbon controller allowing for polyphonic pitch-bends and glissandos. This can be heard on the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis, in which virtually all the sounds are created from the CS-80.
The CS-80 is known as being one of the heaviest self-contained analog synthesizers, weighing over 200 lb (91 kg). This vast instrument is notoriously tricky to service, as there are fewer and fewer engineers capable of CS-80 upkeep. One of the most notable issues is the tuning, if moved with anything but care the keyboard will detune. For this reason they should be serviced at their usual location or at a reputable shop. These days the CS-80 is mostly owned by studios and collectors who wish to preserve this unique machine. The current price on the market for a mint Yamaha CS-80 is around 4,000 to 15000GBP (with MIDI versions costing even more).
The CS-80 was discontinued in 1980.
