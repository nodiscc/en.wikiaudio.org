'''George Robert ("Bob") Vincent''' (July 17, 1898 - November 13, 1985) was a pioneer in the field of sound recording and archiving.

In 1912, he brought a [[wax cylinder]] recording device, which he had borrowed from his friend [[Charles Edison]], to the home of former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Teddy Roosevelt]], and convinced Roosevelt to speak into it. This began his private collection of voice recordings of notable individuals and witnesses to history.

In 1922, after graduating from Yale, he joined [[Thomas Edison|Edison Laboratories]] and worked in the restoration and preservation of antique recordings.

During the [[Second World War]], Vincent helped establish the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]]; in 1943, his intervention in the musicians' strike led to the creation of the [[V-Disc]].

In 1962, he donated his collection of over 8,000 voice recordings to the Libraries of [[Michigan State University]]; it became the basis of the [[Michigan_State_University_Libraries#Vincent_Voice_Library_Collection|G. Robert Vincent Voice Library]], which. Vincent was named assistant to the Director of the Libraries of MSU and curator of the Voice Library, a position he retained until retiring in 1973.
