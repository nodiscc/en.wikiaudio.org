==General guidelines==

*A hardwood floor or hard surface is essential to getting a good conga sound.Place on the floor, not on a stand

*Recording in a small room will generally give a bad sound for these kinds of drums.

===Microphone placement===

'''Each technique begins with a bullet point.'''

*Place the microphone (a small diaphragm condenser or dynamic) about 12 inches above each drum and 1 to 2 inches in front of the outer rim 
*Place the microphones so they are a few feet in front of and below the rim of the congas and angled upward directed at the players eyes.
