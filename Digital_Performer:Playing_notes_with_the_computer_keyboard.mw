To insert notes and other [[MIDI]] data with the computer keyboard go to '''Studio/MIDI Keys'''. A window will appear and you can either click the notes or enter them with the computer keyboard. You can do this while recording into [[Digital Performer]] on a MIDI or [[software instrument]] track as well.
