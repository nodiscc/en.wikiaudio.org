A '''piano roll editor''' is a type of graphic editor used to edit [[MIDI]] data in a MIDI sequencer or [[DAW]]. Characteristics typically include a piano style note display, a corresponding grid where recorded notes are displayed (and can be manually positioned) and a lane display for continuous non-note MIDI data.
