'''Vector Synthesis''' is a type of [[Synthesizer|audio synthesis]] introduced by [[Sequential Circuits]] in the Prophet VS synthesizer during 1986. The concept was subsequently used by [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] in the SY22/TG33 and similar instruments and by [[Korg]] in the [[Korg Wavestation|Wavestation]].

Vector synthesis provides movement in a sound by providing dynamic cross-fading between (usually) four sound sources. The four sound sources are conceptually arranged as the extreme points of X and Y axes, and typically labelled A, B, C and D. A given mix of the four sound sources can be represented by a single point in this 'vector plane'. Movement of the point provides sonic interest and is the power of this technique. Mixing is frequently done using a joystick, although the point can be controlled using [[Envelope_generator|envelope generators]] or [[Low_frequency_oscillation|LFOs]].

==Vector synthesis implementations==
There have been a number of different implementations of vector synthesis. These differ in what they use for the four sound sources, and what processing is done to the sound after the vector synthesis stage. The actual vector synthesis concept is identical.

===Prophet VS vector synthesis===
The Prophet VS used four digital wavetable oscillators based on those in the [[PPG Wave]] as its four sound sources. The limitations, particularly the [[Aliasing|digital aliasing]], of this design, coupled with its use of Curtis analogue filter ICs to process the mixed sound, gave the Prophet VS its distinctive sound.

===Yamaha SY series===
The [[Yamaha SY22]] added to the Prophet's implementation of vector synthesis by providing two types of sound source. Each axis of the vector had both an [[Frequency_modulation_synthesis|FM sound source]] and a sample-playback source.
Although it lacked any filtering, it added digital effects for processing the results of the vector synthesis.

=== Korg Wavestation===
The [[Korg Wavestation]] went further still, allowing each of the four sound sources to produce not just a static tone, but a complex wave sequence, by playing back or cross-fading one wave after another.

===Korg OASYS===
The [[Korg OASYS]] workstation is one of the first synthesizers for over a decade to feature vector synthesis. It also features an updated form of wave sequencing, like the Wavestation.
