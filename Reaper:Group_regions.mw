Now  when you move these items they will be grouped and move together. To  ungroup items just click the icon in the upper left corner of the  region.





You  can also enable/disable item grouping and then move grouped items  around and re-enable item grouping. This way you can change the relationship between the grouped items. You can do this by clicking the  group items enable/disable icon in the upper left corner of the main tracks window [[File:Reaper group items icon.png]] or [[File:Reaper groupI.png]] (later version).
