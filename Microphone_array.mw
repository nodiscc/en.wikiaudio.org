== Microphone array ==



A '''microphone array''' is any number of [[microphone]]s operating in tandem. There are many applications:
*Systems for extracting voice input from ambient noise (notably telephones, speech recognition systems, hearing aids) 
*[[Surround sound]] and related technologies
*Locating objects by sound: [[acoustic source localization]], e.g. military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire. Aircraft location and tracking.
*High fidelity original recordings 
Typically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones distributed about the perimeter of a space, linked to a computer that records and interprets the results into a coherent form. Arrays may also be formed using numbers of very closely spaced microphones. Given a fixed physical relationship in space between the different individual microphone transducer array elements, simultaneous DSP ( Digital signal processor ) processing of the signals from each of the individual microphone array elements can create one or more "virtual" microphones. Different algorithms permit the creation of virtual microphones with extremely complex virtual polar patterns and even the possibility to steer the individual lobes of the virtual microphones patterns so as to home-in-on, or to reject, particular sources of sound.

There are some implementation of microphone arrays that are really big. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an array of 1020 microphones <ref>[http://cag.csail.mit.edu/mic-array/] </ref> has been built.

Microsoft's Windows Vista computer operating system computer operating system has built-in support for microphone arrays for increasing the accuracy of its speech recognition feature, letting users connect multiple microphones to a single system, so that the inputs can be combined into a single, higher-quality source.

== Soundfield microphone ==

The [[Soundfield microphone]] system is a well established example of the use of a microphone array in professional sound recording.
