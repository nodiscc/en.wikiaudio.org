==Multiple program and bank changes in arrange window==

To manually add a program change in the arrange window to a MIDI track you must select the region and then change the program settings in the [[Ableton_Live:Clip_view_parameters#Notes_.28MIDI_clips_only.29|'''Notes''' box]]. If you recorded a performance and wish to have multiple patch changes on the same track, you must [[Ableton Live:Split|split the MIDI recording]] and then set a different program (and/or bank and sub bank) value in the '''Notes''' box
