A '''guitar speaker''' is a [[loudspeaker]] – specifically the driver ([[transducer]]) part – designed for use in or with the [[guitar amplifier]] of an [[electric guitar]]. Typically these drivers produce only the frequency range relevant to guitars which is similar to a regular [[woofer]] type driver which is approximately 75&thinsp;[[Herz|Hz]]&thinsp;—&thinsp;5 kHz.

The cones of these drivers typically range in size from 6.5&thinsp;[[Inch|in]] to 15&thinsp;in with 10 and 12&thinsp;in models being the most popular. As with all loudspeaker drivers, the magnets are usually made from [[Alnico]], ceramic, or [[neodymium]] with higher quality Alnico magnets reserved for expensive models.

Well-known guitar speaker manufacturers include [[Fane Acoustics Limited|Fane]], [[Jensen Loudspeakers|Jensen]], [[Celestion]], [[Eminence Speaker|Eminence]], [[Electro-Voice]], [[JBL]], [[Weber Speakers|Weber]], and [[A Brown Soun]] (Tone Tubby).

==Cabinet==

The speaker cabinets which hold these drivers can be closed-back or open-back, along with variations such as a semi-open back 4x12&thinsp;in cabinet, which may have a baffle deflecting two of the four speakers. Closed back cabinets can be [[acoustic suspension]] (rare, due in part to lower efficiency and distortion) or [[bass reflex]] (higher efficiency but, if properly designed, also low distortion). A 4x12&thinsp;in speaker cabinet has four 12&thinsp;in speakers; a 2x10&thinsp;in speaker cabinet has two 10&thinsp;in speakers.  Bass cabinets often have multiple different-sized speakers.

When driven hard, guitar speakers produce complex behavior. There will be some [[power compression]], several kinds of [[distortion]], even mechanical limiting as one or more drivers run against their physical limits (eg, cone excursion). A guitar speaker cabinet simulator circuit attempts to emulate the complex behavior of a guitar speaker as an aid to design. A common microphone used to pick up guitar speaker sound is  the [[Shure SM57]] or the [[Sennheiser]] 421.

For convenience, there is often an amplifier head built into the cabinet. The combination can be -- somewhat misleadingly – referred to as a [[guitar amplifier]], but is actually called a [[combo amp|"combo"]].
