A '''dynamic microphone''' is a microphone that works via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their high gain before feedback makes them ideal for on-stage use. Moving coil microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a loudspeaker, only reversed. A small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying current in the coil through electromagnetic induction. A single dynamic membrane will not respond linearly to all audio frequencies. Some microphones for this reason utilize multiple membranes for the different parts of the audio spectrum and then combine the resulting signals. Combining the multiple signals correctly is difficult and designs that do this are rare and tend to be expensive. There are on the other hand several designs that are more specifically aimed towards isolated parts of the audio spectrum. Traditionally Dynamic microphones do not require phantom power , however some dynamic microphones such as the [[Blue Kickball]] are ''active dynamic'' and do require phantom powering.
