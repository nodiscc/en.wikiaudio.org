'''Parallel compression,''' also known as New York compression, is a technique used in sound recording and mixing. Parallel compression is achieved by mixing a dry or slightly compressed signal with a heavily compressed identical signal. It is thought to maintain the subtleties of a performance while stabilizing the dynamics. Additionally, the attack and release settings of the compressor can be set in a manner that causes the signal to "pump" or "breathe" in tempo with the song, adding an identifiable character to the sound. It is most usually used on drum buses.

It is sometimes erroneously referred to as sidechain compression.
