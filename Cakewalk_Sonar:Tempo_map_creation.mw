To create a [[tempo map]] in Sonar you can use the '''Fit improvisation''' feature under the ''file'' menu. 
The way that it works is like this.

Add an audio file you would like to create a tempo map for.
In our example we will use a short 1 bar long file for brevity, (image below) but you can use one that is song length.

Now create a [[MIDI]] track.

Play notes on the MIDI track that correlate with the beats of the audio file. 
Our file is in 4/4 time so we record ''quarter'' notes. 
Make sure the first MIDI note lands at the very beginning of the song.

Once you do this go to '''Process / Fit Improvisation'''.

A series of tempo changes will then be created allowing the songs MIDI tempo to accommodate the audio region.
