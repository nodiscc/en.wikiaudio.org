'''Akai''' is a consumer electronics brand, originally founded as a Japanese manufacturer in 1929. It is now headquartered in Singapore, and is part of Grande Holdings, a Chinese Hong Kongâ€“based conglomerate, which also owns Japanese brands Nakamichi and Sansui. The Akai brand is now used to rebadge electronics manufactured by other companies.
In 1984, a new division of the company was formed to focus on the manufacture and sale of electronic instruments, and was called Akai Electronic Musical Instruments Corporation, or Akai Professional.
