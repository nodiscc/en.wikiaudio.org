The vibrator pedal is an effects pedal present on some musical instruments, which is similar to a vibrato, chorus, or autopan, it combines a modulation sequence with a noise gate or envelope filter to create an effect not unlike a helicopter, with rapid cutting out and coming inâ€”on and off. Most have variable speeds and depths, creating different sounds.

Vibrator Pickup

Also called a sustainer pick-up, it is a small electro magnet placed near the high fretboard of an electric guitar, whose strength varies (controlled via circuit board and 9v battery inside the guitar) causing the strings to vibrate. Sounds vibrator pickups make have been compared to strings sections, without the slow attack caused by a bow.
