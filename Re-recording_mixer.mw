A '''re-recording mixer''', formerly known as a dubbing mixer, is a person who is part of a post-production sound team and works specifically with dialog, music and sound effects to create the final soundtrack for a production. They are responsible for ensuring that the sound in a film or television program is technically correct, and as near to the director's or sound designer's original idea.

Re-recording mixers prepare an initial film soundtrack for audience previews by performing tasks such as mixing and cross-fading the sound, and adding a temporary music soundtrack that will have been prepared by the music editor. After the previews, the film is usually re-cut and the sound is mixed once more. Once the film is given its final approval by the producer and financial backers, the re-recording mixer works towards a final surround sound mix.
