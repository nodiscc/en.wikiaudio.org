==Reading binary==

Binary is composed of a series of "on" or "off" values called bits.  Bits are read in 8bit groupings called bytes and these have an equivalent decimal value.

Bytes are read from right to left and each bit is double in value form the last. An entire byte has 8 bits and is equal to 256 when converted to its "decimal" value.
