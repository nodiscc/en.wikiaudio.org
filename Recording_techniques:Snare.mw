==General guidelines==

For more "crack" of the snare drum use a well placed room [[microphone]].The "crack" doesn't necessarily come from close miking.

===Microphone placement===
'''Each technique begins with a bullet point'''

*Aim a microphone at the side of snare and point it at the shell.Position it 4-8 inches away.Move it closer to the bottom head for more "snare sound" and closer to the top for more "attack" sound.<ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook.ISBN 1-93292-900-2 </ref> 

*Aim a microphone directly at the side of the rim and about 2 inches above it.The microphone should be right above the rim of the snare aiming at the far edge. <ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook.ISBN 1-93292-900-2 </ref> 

*Use a Beyer 201 dynamic with a small condenser such as a Shure SM98 or AKG 451 strapped to the side with the diaphragms aligned and miking the top of the snare. <ref>The Recording Engineers Handbook.Steve Albini interview.Page 250 ISBN 1-93292-900-2 </ref> 

*Choose a close miking configuration for the snare drum and then place an additional condenser microphone wherever the snare sounds great (don't worry about too much leakage - just get a great sound). Then when mixing down gate the second mic and have the close mic open it via a [[side chain]] configuration.
