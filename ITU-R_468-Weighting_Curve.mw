The '''ITU-R 468-weighting curve''' (originally defined in CCIR recommendation 468) is widely used when measuring noise in audio systems, especially in the UK, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa. It is less well known in the USA where [[A-weighting]] has always been used.
