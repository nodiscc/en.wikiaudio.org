'''Freeze tracks''' is a feature available in some [[DAW]]'s where a temporary render or bounce of a file is done to a track (or tracks) and then any assigned plug-in's to that track(s) are temporarily disabled. This is done to free the computers processor from the burden of running said plug-in's in real-time while still allowing the user to play the tracks with their audible effects.
