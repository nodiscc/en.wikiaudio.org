To split a region in Reaper you must:

#Select the track with the region (by clicking on the track so it's highlighted)
#Place the cursor where you want the split, or if you want to split by locators place the locators where you want the split (image below)

'''Note:'''

*If no Item is selected, pressing S will split all Items on all Tracks at the Edit Cursor position.
*If Item(s) are selected, pressing S will split all selected Item(s) at the Edit Cursor position.
