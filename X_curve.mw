== X curve ==
The '''X curve''' is an equalization curve intended for film theater applications originally created in the 1970's. X-Curve is defined in ISO Bulletin 2969 as pink noise, at the listening position in a dubbing situation or two-thirds of the way back in a theater, to be flat to 2 kHz, rolling off 3 dB/octave after that. <ref> [http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_9_2/feature-article-curves-6-2002.html] Hometheaterhifi.com vol 9</ref>
