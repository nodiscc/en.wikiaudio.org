A '''synthesizer''' (or '''synthesiser''') is an electronic instrument capable of producing a variety of sounds by generating and combining signals of different frequencies. A modern digital synthesizer uses a frequency synthesizer microprocessor component to calculate mathematical functions, which generate signals of different frequencies. There are three main types of synthesizers, which differ in operation: analog, digital and software-based. Synthesizers create electrical signals, rather than direct acoustic sounds, which are then amplified through a loudspeaker or set of headphones.

Synthesizers are typically controlled with a piano-style keyboard, in which the keys function as a switch to turn electronic circuits on and off. Although keyboards are the most common control interface, other devices such as saxophone-style wind controllers, MIDI-equipped electric guitars, drum pads or computers are used to control synthesizers. Synthesizers can produce a wide range of sounds, which can either imitate other instruments or generate unusual new timbres.

The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by Elisha Gray, who is best known for his development of a telephone prototype
