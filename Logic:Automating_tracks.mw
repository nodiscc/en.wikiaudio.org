==Logic 9==


'''<big>Note</big>'''

The automation for '''Logic 9''' is the same as '''Logic 8''' the only difference is the placement of the Track Automation menu. In Logic 9 it can be accessed under the Track menu or by clicking a region while holding control. This is opposed to the options menu shown [[Logic:_Automation_of_audio_tracks#Move_Current_Track_automation_data_to_region|here.]]

== Logic 8 and 9: Automation of audio tracks ==


To automate tracks in [[Apple Logic]] the first thing you need to do is click and hold the [[automation modes]] selector and then select the mode you wish to use from the list. The automation modes are highlighted in red below.

===Automation modes===
A description of the modes is as follows:

====Off====
Automation is turned off.

====Read==== 
Automation is read but not written.

====Touch====
Automation is written when track parameters are moved (but not before) and then when the mouse is lifted reverts back to it's previous state and does not overwrite further.

====Latch====
Automation is written when the track parameters are moved and then continues to overwrite even when the mouse is lifted.

====Write====
Automation overwrites all existing data before and after the mouse is lifted.

===Displaying automation===
 

After you record the track automation if you would like to see a visual representation of it displayed on the track then click "View" and "Track Automation"
