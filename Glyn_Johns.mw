'''Glyn Johns''' (born February 15, 1942 in Epsom, Surrey, England) is a musician, recording engineer and record producer.

He has worked with such artists as Small Faces, The Eagles, The Beatles, The Steve Miller Band, The Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Ronnie Lane - "How Come" Single, Gallagher and Lyle, Georgie Fame, Family, Eric Clapton, The Clash, Midnight Oil and the Blue Ã–yster Cult, plus Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris, New Model Army, Belly, Joe Satriani, Helen Watson, and many others.

After an ill-fated singing career in the 1960s with the band The Presidents, Johns began working as a recording studio engineer at IBC Studios, Portland Place, London. In 1969, Johns was called upon to rescue the troublesome Get Back sessions for The Beatles. Johns compiled several versions of the album, which were all rejected by the band, before the project was eventually turned over to producer Phil Spector. Spector's version became the released album, which was retitled Let It Be.

Johns' subsequent work on the first three albums by the Eagles was fundamental in establishing the group's sound and style.

In 1971, he co-produced The Who's Who's Next, one of the most celebrated rock albums of all time. The band is also credited as co-producers.

Glyn Johns is the father of Ethan Johns and the older brother of Andy Johns, both accomplished producers in their own right. Ethan has worked with acts such as Ryan Adams and the Kings of Leon, and Andy has worked with acts such as The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix, either on his own or under the tutelage of Eddie Kramer. He was also the engineer for Brian Jones' soundtrack to Mord und Totschlag (A Degree of Murder).
