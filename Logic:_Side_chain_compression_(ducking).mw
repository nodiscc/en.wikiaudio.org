For this tutorial you will need a control signal and an affected signal.

For our [[side chain]] example we will use a kick [[drum]] (control signal) to trigger a [[compressor]] which will dynamically attenuate (or ''[[Ducking|duck]]'') a track with a sustained note (the affected signal).

This means every time the kick drum plays the [[sustain]]ed note will be compressed.


To accomplish  this follow these steps:

#Create 2 [[software instrument]] tracks (You can use audio or instrument tracks for this effect, but for our example we are using instrument tracks)
#On the first track insert a software instrument with a drum kit and record a kick drum on every quarter note for 2 [[bar]]s. After your done, insert '''Bus 1''' into the ''sends'' field of the tracks channel strip  and turn it up.This will automatically create an '''[[aux track]]''' with the input as [[Bus]] 1, this is unnecessary for what we are trying to do so go to the ''aux track'' channel strip and change the input to '''no input'''
#On the second [[software instrument]] track record a [[sustain]]ed note that plays for 2 bars ( you can do this by opening up the ES1 on a software instrument track and using the default patch).
#Now on the track you just recorded the sustained note on ,add a compressor plug in to it's respective channel strip. In the side chain field of the compressor click, hold and select '''Bus 1''' as shown in the image below.

#Push play on the [[transport]]
#Turn the compressors ratio all the way up and begin to pull the threshold down. You should hear the sustain note begin to fluctuate in [[volume]] in accordance with the kick drum hitting, if not try pulling up the gain on the compressor
