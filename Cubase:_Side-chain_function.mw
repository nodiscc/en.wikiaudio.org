==Steps==

Start by inserting a plug-in capable of performing a side-chain function on a track requiring the effect.  The side chain option is circled in the image below.

This will enable every track in your session (including group tracks) to route the audio to the plug-in.

Select the send destination, set level as desired.The settings in the screen shot below are for maximum effect of the Gate viz. 0dB and post-fader <br />

The audio signal will only be allowed to pass through the gate upon a ‘trigger’ signal from the sending track <br />

====Note====
As a rule it is not possible to create a side-chain effect within the same track <br />


 

==Cubase 3 and earlier==
This capability was not available in the older Cubase standard compressor plug-in, among others, but was only added in '''version 4''' <br />
