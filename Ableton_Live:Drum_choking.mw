Choking is when one sound such as an open hi-hat is cut off by another sound , such as a closed hi-hat.

You can manually set up samples to choke one another automatically in Live by following these steps.

'''1.''' [[Ableton Live:Add instrument device|Open up an instance of the '''Drum Rack'''.]]

'''2.''' Add a few sounds to the pads that you would like to have choke each other.

'''3.''' Click the '''chain list''' and '''i/o''' icons to the left of the device (image below).

'''4.''' Set the choke number the same on all drum samples that you would like to have choke each other. (image below)
