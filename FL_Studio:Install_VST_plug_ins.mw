VST plug ins either have one of two types of installations. They are either a regular program install or a Dll file.

To install a VST plug in that has a Dll file-type install, you must go to the Image Line folder directory and then got to '''FL Studio / Plug ins/ VST''' and drop the Dll file in it. Then launch FL Studio and the VST should be available.
