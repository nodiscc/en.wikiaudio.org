==Guidelines==

*Didjeridu's have a lot of sub sonic frequencies, so using a low cut filer might be appropriate 
*Sound emanates from the entire instrument so the bell of the instrument should not be closely miked.
----



===Microphone placement===


'''Each technique begins with a bullet point.'''

*Place a small diaphragm condenser or dynamic microphone at the bell about 3-4 inches away.Mike the instrument for low-end clarity.
*Attach a clip-on omni condenser microphone on the end of the bell.
