Technical Specs

* Multiple In/Out connections: XLR balanced; ¼" -10dbV output for 'no-latency' DAW monitoring; high-Z input on front panel (disconnects mic input): TRS ¼” insert patch point for compressor or equalizer ahead of the output amplifier
* Adjustable gain stages: input in 5db steps to 60db; output from -25 to +10db; maximum overall gain 70db; 2 to 3 stages of single ended solid state amplifier gain blocks, depending on gain structure; high-current 70ma Class A bias on output stage
* Input and output meters on each channel (dual-stage metering is a Great River exclusive)
* Front panel switches: polarity; phantom power; input impedance (1200 / 300 ohm); output loading (600 ohm resistor across output transformer)
* High quality, custom wound Sowter transformers
* Gold plated switching contacts
* Local power supply regulation on each channel
* 110 or 220 volt operation with external selection, either 50 or 60 Hz
* 3 year warranty with registration
* Single rack space with internal power supply
