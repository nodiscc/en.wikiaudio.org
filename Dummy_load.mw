In [[audio]] and electrical engineering a '''dummy load''' is an artificial device that draws current or power from an electrical circuit, this is used typically for testing purposes. 

For example, when testing audio amplifiers it is common to replace the loudspeaker with a dummy load, so that the amplifier's handling of large power levels can be tested without actually producing intense sound.
