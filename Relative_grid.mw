A [[relative grid]] is a grid in which data is moved in increments that reflect the ''grid units'' of an audio software program or [[DAW]]. This is in contrast to an [[absolute grid]] which is a linear timing grid in a [[DAW]] or other audio software program that snaps audio and other data to exact points on the time scale.
