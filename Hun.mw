The hun is a Korean [[ocarina]] made of baked clay or ceramic. It is globular shape, with a blowing hole on top and several finger holes. It is used primarily in court music ensembles, although in the late 20th century some contemporary Korean composers began to use it in their compositions and film scores.

The hun is derived from the Chinese xun, one of the oldest Chinese instruments. In Japan, the equivalent instrument is called tsuchibue (lit. "Japanese clay flute").
