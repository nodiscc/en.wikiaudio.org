'''Microphonics''' describes the phenomenon where certain components in electronic devices transform mechanical vibrations (ringing) into an undesired electrical signal (noise). The term is derived by analogy to older microphones where that behavior is inherent in the design, while with modern electronics it is sometimes an intentionally added effect.
