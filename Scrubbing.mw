'''Scrubbing''' is an effect that originated with analog tape recorders in which the tape was rocked back and forth past the play head to locate precise positions for splicing and other editing.
Digital audio scrubbing is now a feature used in some audio computer programs and [[DAW]]'s as a means to locate precise edit points.
