'''AM Stereo''' is a term given to a number of mutually incompatible techniques for broadcasting stereo audio in the AM band in a manner that is compatible with standard AM receivers. There are two main classes of systems: independent sideband (ISB) systems, promoted principally by American broadcast engineer Leonard Kahn; and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) multiplexing systems (conceptually closer to FM stereo).
