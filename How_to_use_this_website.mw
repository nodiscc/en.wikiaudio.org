At the most basic all you need to do is use the search field to find information you want to know. If you can't find the information you are looking for you can post a question or request in our forum.


If you would like to sign up and be a registered member of WikiAudio you can then take advantage of our token voucher system.

The way this works is the moderator will award you tokens when you make substantial contributions to WikiAudio such as an article, tutorial, how to video or audio file demonstrating recording techniques. These tokens can then be exchanged for vouchers on items in the WikiAudio shop.

If you have any questions just post them in the forum.
