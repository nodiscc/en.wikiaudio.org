'''Tap tempo''' is a phrase used to describe the process of generating a [[tempo]] in a [[MIDI]] sequencing or [[DAW]] program which entails the user manually "tapping" a MIDI note,mouse click or some other input device. The receiving software or hardware then calculates a tempo based on the timing from the respective "taps".
