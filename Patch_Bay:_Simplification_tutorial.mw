The patchbay allows us to interconnect outboard gear, console, tape machine, and tie lines in a non-permanent manner. This is done so that all source and destination configurations are easily accessible.



==Connectors==

Different patchbays are configured to accept different types of connectors.

Some types are

#1/4 inch
# T. T.

All balanced connections and the patch cords are usually about 1 meter in length.

==Connections==

===Fully Normalled===

'''Fully Normalled:''' A cable inserted into either top or bottom jack breaks the internal connection and signal now flows through the patch cable.

===Half Normalled===

'''Half Normalled:''' plugging a patch cable into the top jack does not break the signal, but creates a Y split. Plugging into the bottom jack breaks the normal top to bottom connection and allow signal to flow from the top to the bottom jack through the patch cable.

===Non Normal===

'''Non Normal:''' This configuration consists of only input and output points for devices not normally connected to the console. No signal is traveling from the top to bottom jacks.

===The I/O section===


===The I/O section===

The I/O patch points receive signal from the individual channels and return that signal to several places in signal flow.
#Mic Lines – The outputs of the microphone before the pre amp.
#Channel Mic Inputs – Input to the mic preamp.
#MTR Returns – Output of each track from the MTR.
#Channel Line Inputs – Input to the line position of the mic/line switch.
#Channel Insert Sends – Pre or post equalizer signal from the I/O.
#Channel Insert Returns – Signal enters the I/O either pre or post EQ.
#Group outputs – output of each individual buss in the routing matrix.
#MTR Sends – Input to each track of the MTR
#MTR Returns – output of each track on the MTR.
#Monitor Inputs – Input to the monitor fader/monitor path.


==Some Terminology==

===In line patching===
'''In line patching''' – AKA patching across. This technique is when signal from the I/O is sent to a processor, & returned to the same I/O (i.e. insert send & returns).

===Dead patch===
'''Dead Patch''' – Using a patch cord to interrupt the signal path from one jack to the other.

===Cross Patch===
'''Cross Patch''' – To patch from a source to a different destination jack.

===Mult===
'''Mult''' – A poor mans distribution amp. A string of jacks, wired in parallel, so that all the jacks will see the same signal. '''''Mult''' is short for multiplier.''
