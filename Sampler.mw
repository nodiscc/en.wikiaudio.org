A '''sampler''' is an electronic musical instrument closely related to a [[synthesizer]]. Instead of generating sounds from scratch, however, a sampler starts with multiple recordings (or "samples") of different sounds, and then plays each back based on how the instrument is configured. Because these samples are usually stored in RAM, the information can be quickly accessed.
