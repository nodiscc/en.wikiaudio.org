'''Resistance wire''' is electrical wire used for its resistance. It is routinely used at high temperatures, so normally also has high melting point. Resistance wire is usually used for high-power resistors and heating elements, which produce heat used in electric heaters, electric ovens and toasters, and many other appliances.

==Types==
Nichrome, a non-magnetic alloy of nickel and chromium, is commonly used to make resistance wire because it has a high resistivity and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures. When used as a heating element, resistance wire is usually wound into coils.

Constantan is used where resistance is required to not change with temperature. Constantan is readily solderable, though soldered joints have limited temperature range.

Many elements and alloys have been used as resistance wire for special purposes. Copper is also included for comparison.
