In acoustics, '''simultaneous masking''' is masking between two concurrent sounds.It is sometimes called frequency masking since it is often observed when the sounds share a frequency band e.g. two sine tones at 440 and 450Hz can be perceived clearly when separated. They cannot be perceived clearly when simultaneous.
