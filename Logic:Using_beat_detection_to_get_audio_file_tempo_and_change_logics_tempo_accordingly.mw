Beat detection is used to find the tempo of an audio file. You can also use Beat Detection to have Logic's tempo change in a manner that conforms to the detected tempo of the audio file.


To use beat detection follow these steps


Select an audio file that has been placed on a track.



Then go to '''Option menu/Tempo/Adjust Tempo Using Beat Detection'''

The window that appears will automatically display the tempo that has been found for the audio material and it will be listed in the '''Resulting Tempo''' value. If you click the '''Advanced options''' you should get additional options including other possible tempo's of the audio material. 

If you think the '''Resulting Tempo''' value is incorrect you can  choose one of the other values if they seem more accurate.
