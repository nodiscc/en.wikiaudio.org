==Bass amplifier recording techniques==

'''Guidelines'''
*Always make sure to check [[phase]] relationship between the DI and amplifier if recording both.
*If recording into a DAW you can align the amplifier track with the DI track to make them more in phase.

===Microphone Placement===
'''Each technique begins with a bullet point.'''

*Use a large diaphragm microphone such as a [[AKG D112|D-112,B52]] or [[Electrovoice RE20|RE-20]] and use in combination with a [[Shure SM57]]. Point them at the amp off center and a few inches away from the cone. Mix the large diaphragm mic with just a little bit of the SM57.

*Split the signal with a DI.Send one to a bass amp and mic with a large diaphragm condenser microphone.Now send the other signal to a guitar amp and set it to distort and give it a dirty sound. EQ the guitar amp to taste. Mix the DI signal in to taste.
