<big>'''Specifications'''</big>

* Input:
* Balanced, using "Transformer-Like-Amplifier" (TLA) with toroidal common mode rejection low pass filter that excludes frequencies above 150kHz.
* The T.L.A. is followed by an actual input transformer permitting a full +26dBu input signal to be handled at unity gain without an input pad over the whole audio spectrum.
* Combines the advantages of both an "Electronically Balanced" and true Transformer input.
* When the phantom voltage is disabled, this input serves as a very high quality Line Input.

'''Input Impedance: 10,000 ohm, + or 20%'''

'''Noise:'''
* Measured at Main Output: Input terminated with 150 Ohms.
* Measured over band limited 22Hz-22kHz, Unweighted:
* With Gain at Unity: Better than 100 dBu;With Gain at 66dB:
* Better than 62dBu

'''Equivalent Input Noise (EIN)'''
* Better than 128dBu

'''Frequency Response: Main Output, no load:'''
* @ 10Hz, 0.2dB
* @ 160kHz 3dB

'''Buss Output @ 10Hz: 0.2dB @ 160kHz 3dB'''
* High-Pass Filter: Swept frequency continuously variable from 20Hz to 250Hz.
* Slope: 12dB/Octave.
*Gain: Switched Gain from Unity to +66dB in 6dB steps.
* "Trim": Continuously adjustable potentiometer from 6dB to +6dB with reference to setting on the Gain Switch.
* Maximum Output Level: Balanced and floating transformer output from 20Hz to 40kHz: +25dBu. (Clips at just over +26dBu)
* Mute: Mutes main output only. (i.e. Monitor remains "live")

'''Total Harmonic Distortion and Noise:'''
* Main Output @ 1kHz, +20dBu output level, no load: Better than 0.001%.
* (No high order Harmonics)
* Silk Engaged: Approximately 0.2% Second Harmonic
* Main Output @ 20Hz, +20dBu output level, no load: Better than 0.01%.
* Buss Output @ 1kHz, +20dBu output level, no load, measured at the output: Better than 0.002%.
*Crosstalk: Measured channel to channel - better than 90dB @ 15kHz.
* Phantom Power: +48VDC +/ 1%

'''Main power required (from external power unit):''' 
*Voltage range, 9 to 18VDC.

'''Current consumption:'''
* @ 9VDC = 1.3 A typical
* @12VDC = 1A typical
* @15VDC= 800 mA typical
* @18VDC= 650 mA typical

*Rear Panel Power Connector: 5.5mm X 2.1mm DC jack, center positive
