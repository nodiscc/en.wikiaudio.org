===Voice and Performance===

If you edit a '''voice''' or '''performance''' and then toggle to a different voice or performance, you will lose the edits you made to the previous voice/performance unless you save.

If you accidentally do this there is one way to retrieve the data using the Mo's recall function.

*Go to the voice or performance push '''JOB'''
*Push the button below the '''Recall''' function displayed on the screen (F2)
*Push '''enter.'''

It also has a "recall" feature in case you forget to save.
