A '''software synthesizer''', also known as a soft synth is a computer program or DAW plug in used for digital audio generation. Computer software which can create sounds or music is not new, but advances in processing speed are allowing softsynths to accomplish the same tasks as dedicated hardware. Softsynths can be cheaper and more portable than dedicated hardware, and easier to interface with other music software such as music sequencers.
