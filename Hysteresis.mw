'''Hysteresis''' is the phenomena where a device or system which is presented with a rising stimulus of one value, and a declining stimulus of the same value responds in a manner where the response is different when ''ideally'' it ''should'' always be the same. In analog audio hysteresis is common in magnetic materials which leads to distortion in analog tape recordings. Biasing is used to mediate this effect.
