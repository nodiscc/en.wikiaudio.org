The '''Cher effect''' is an informal term used to describe extreme digital [[pitch correction]] of singing to produce a semi-artificial voice [[sound effect]]<ref name="Cher"> [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb99/articles/tracks661.htm Sue Sillitoe, Sound On Sound, February, 1999. "Recording Cher's 'Believe]</ref>. In its typical application, the natural small variations of pitch in human singing are flattened to exact notes, with a noticeable gliding between the notes. The sound is comparable to certain effects that can be produced with a [[vocoder]], but is closer to a natural human voice.

The technique was made popular by the 1998 Cher song Believe"<ref name="Cher"/> , and has since become prevalent to more obvious or more subtle degrees throughout electronic-oriented popular music. The effect has been closely associated with the [[Antares Audio Technologies|Antares]] [[Auto-Tune]] audio effect software, which is reputed to have been used on "Believe".
