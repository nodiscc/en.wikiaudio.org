Electrical tension (or voltage after its SI unit, the volt) is the difference of electrical potential between two points of an electrical or electronic circuit, expressed in volts<ref>"voltage", ''A Dictionary of Physics''. Ed. John Daintith. Oxford University Press, 2000. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.</ref>. It is the measurement of the potential for an electric field to cause an electric current in an electrical conductor. Depending on the difference of electrical potential it is called extra low voltage, low voltage, high voltage or extra high voltage. Specifically, voltage is equal to energy per unit charge.<ref>"To find the electric potential difference between two points A and B in an electric field, we move a test charge ''q<sub>0</sub>'' from A to B, always keeping it in equilibrium, and we measure the work ''W<sub>AB</sub>'' that must be done by the agent moving the charge. The electric potential difference is defined from ''V<sub>B</sub> &minus; V<sub>A</sub> = W<sub>AB</sub>/q<sub>0</sub>''" Halliday, D. and Resnick, R. (1974). ''Fundamentals of Physics''.
