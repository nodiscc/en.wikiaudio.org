'''AES-2id''' is an AES information document published by the [[Audio Engineering Society]] ([http://www.aes.org Official Site])for digital audio engineering -- Guidelines for the use of the [[AES3]] interface. This document provides guidelines for the use of [[AES3]], AES Recommended Practice for Digital Audio Engineering, Serial transmission format for two-channel linearly represented digital audio data. This document also covers the description of related standards used in conjunction with [[AES3]] such as [[AES11]].
The full details of AES-2id can be studied in the standards section of the [[Audio Engineering Society]] [http://www.aes.org/publications/standards/ web site] by downloading copies of the AES-2id document as a PDF file
