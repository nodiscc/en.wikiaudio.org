A '''hydrophone''' (Greek "hydro" = "water" and "phone" = "sound") is a [[microphone]] designed to be used underwater for recording or listening to [[underwater sound]].  Most hydrophones are based on a [[piezoelectric]] [[transducer]] that generates electricity when subjected to a pressure change.  Such piezoelectric materials, or [[transducer]]s can convert a sound signal into an electrical signal since [[sound]] is a pressure wave in fluids.   Some transducers can also serve as a projector ([[emitter]]), but not all have this capability, and may be destroyed if used in such a manner.

A hydrophone can "listen" to sound in air, but will be less sensitive due to its design as having a good [[acoustic impedance]] match to water, the denser fluid.  Likewise, a microphone can be buried in the ground, or immersed in water if it is put in a waterproof container, but will give similarly poor performance due to the similarly bad acoustic impedance match.

==History==
The hydrophone was used late in World War I. Convoy escorts used them to detect U-boats, greatly lessening the effectiveness of the submarine. [[Ernest Rutherford]], in England, led pioneer research in hydrophones using piezoelectric devices. His only patent was for a hydrophone device.

From late in World War One until the introduction of active [[sonar]], hydrophones were the sole method for submarines to detect targets while submerged, and remain useful today.

==Directional hydrophones==
A small single cylindrical ceramic [[transducer]] can achieve near perfect omnidirectional reception.  Directional hydrophones increase sensitivity from one direction using two basic techniques:

===Focused Transducers===
This device uses a single [[transducer]] element with a dish or conical-shaped sound reflector to focus the signals, in a similar manner to a reflecting telescope.  This type of hydrophone can be produced from a low-cost omnidirectional type, but must be used while stationary, as the reflector impedes its movement through water.

===Arrays===
Multiple hydrophones can be arranged in an [[array]] so that it will add the signals from the desired direction while subtracting signals from other directions.  The array may be steered using a beamformer.  Most commonly, hydrophones are arranged in a "line array" but may be in two or three dimensional arrangements.
