If you stop playback in [[Ableton Live]] and then begin playback again, the program will restart at the current loop point (Arrange window) or start from the beginning of the current clip.

If ''instead'' you wish to resume playback from the last position the playhead was at simply hold down '''SHIFT''' and push the spacebar.
