To record Maschine [[MIDI]] notes into your [[DAW]] do these things.

*Add Maschine as a software instrument (not as an insert effect plug in)

*Hold '''SHIFT''' ( very bottom of the hardware fourth button from the left) and push the button '''(MIDI) Control''' (top left side on the hardware)

*Push (Bank) '''E''' (on the hardware under '''GROUPS'''). All pads should be lit. 

*Go to '''Sound MIDI Batch Setup''' in the software (image below)
