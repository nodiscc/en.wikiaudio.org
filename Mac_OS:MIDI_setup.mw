----

First, make sure you know what physical MIDI ports your external MIDI devices are connected to.

#Open up the Mac OS's '''Audio MIDI setup'''. This is in the '''Applications / Utility''' folder
#Go to '''Window''' (menu) & choose '''MIDI devices'''.
#Add a virtual device for every real device you have connected to your MIDI interface. You can do this by clicking the '''"Add Device"''' button..
#When the device appears, double click on it and set the '''Manufacturer''' and '''Model''' fields for your device(s)and make sure all channel buttons for input and output are enabled.
#Then, connect the virtual MIDI cables from the device(s) to the interface to reflect how they are connected physically.
