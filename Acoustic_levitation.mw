'''Acoustic levitation''' is a method for suspending matter in a medium by using acoustic radiation pressure from intense sound waves in the medium. Acoustic levitation is possible because of the non-linear effects of intense sound wavess.<ref> [http://science.howstuffworks.com/acoustic-levitation2.htm   Nonlinear Sound and Acoustic Levitation ]</ref>
