[[Parallel compression]] can be done in Logic by either blending a heavily compressed signal with an uncompressed version of the same signal via a bussing scheme, having both signals on their own respective tracks with one compressed, or by the technique below.

'''1.''' Add a compressor plug in on the track with the signal you wish to add "parallel compression" to.

'''2.''' Compress it heavily.

'''3.''' At the bottom of the compressor plug in click the small arrow in the left side. (image below).

'''4.''' Then use the '''Output Mix''' option to blend the heavily compressed version with the uncompressed version.
