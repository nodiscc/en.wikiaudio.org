The '''MERGE''' mode is provided so that two tracks can be merged together (combined) onto one track. 

To use it:

Make sure you're in part mode (PART button should be lit).
Push the merge button (should be lit).

Press the first desired track (it will light solid), followed by the 
destination track (it will flash), followed by RECORD. This will merge both tracks ''into'' the <u>second track</u>.
