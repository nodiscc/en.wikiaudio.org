'''Each technique begins with a bullet point.'''

*Place a Neumann U-87 around 6 inches above the bridge near the plucking finger.<ref>Norman Putnam interview in The Expert Encyclopedia of Recording ISBN 1-931140-11-1 Page 24. He stated that he used this technique with Al Hirt, Henry Mancinni and Elvis</ref>

*For a sound similar to the old  "Sun Records sound" try using one microphone, the same microphone, to mic the kick drum and bass at the same time. Sam Phillips used an RCA Victor ribbon microphone.He focused on micing the kick drum then had the bass player move closer (in front of the kick) when necessary. <ref name="TEEORPage29">The Expert Encyclopedia of Recording Interview with James Dickenson Page 29 ISBN 1-931140-11-1</ref>
