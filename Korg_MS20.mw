The '''Korg MS-20''' is a patchable semi-modular monophonic synthesizer which Korg released in 1978 and was in production until 1983. It was part of Korg's MS series of instruments, which also included the single oscillator MS-10, the keyboardless MS-50 module, and the SQ-10 sequencer. Additional devices included the MS-01 Foot Controller, MS-02 Interface, MS-03 Signal Processor, MS-04 Modulation Pedal and VC-10 Vocoder.

Although the MS-20 follows a conventional subtractive synthesis architecture of oscillators/filter/vca, its patch panel allows some rerouting of both audio and modulation, and it includes an external signal processor.
