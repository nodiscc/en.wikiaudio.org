== Nominal level ==



'''Nominal level''' is the operating level at which an electronic [[signal processing]] device is designed to operate. The electronic circuits that make up such equipment are limited in the maximum signal they can output and the low-level internally-generated electronic noise they add to the signal. The difference between the internal noise and the maximum output level is the device's [[dynamic range]]. When a signal is chained improperly through many devices, the dynamic range of the signal is reduced. The nominal level is the level that these devices were designed to operate at, for best dynamic range.

In audio, a related measurement, [[signal-to-noise ratio]], is usually defined as the difference between the nominal level and the [[noise floor]], leaving the [[headroom]] as the difference between nominal and maximum output.<ref>[http://www.rane.com/par-s.html#S_N Rane Pro Audio Reference definition of ''signal-to-noise ratio'']</ref><ref>[http://www.rane.com/par-h.html#headroom Rane Pro Audio Reference definition of ''headroom'']</ref> It is important to realize that the measured level is a time [[average]], meaning that the peaks of audio signals regularly exceed the measured average level. The headroom measurement defines how far the peak levels can stray from the nominal measured level before [[clipping (audio)|clipping]]. The difference between the peaks and the average for a given signal is the [[crest factor]].

There is some confusion over the use of the term "[[Real versus nominal value|nominal]]", which is often used incorrectly to mean "average or typical". The relevant definition in this case is "as per design"; [[gain]] is applied to make the average signal level correspond to the designed, or nominal, level.

== Standards ==

[[VU meter]]s are designed to represent the perceived [[loudness]] of a passage of music, measuring in [[volume unit]]s. The product is designed so that the best signal quality is obtained when the meter rarely goes above nominal. The markings are often in [[decibel|dB]] instead of "VU", and the reference level is defined in the product's manual. In professional [[audio recording|recording]] and [[sound reinforcement]] gear, the nominal level is 0 VU = +4 [[dBu]]. In consumer level equipment, the nominal level varies, but some standardize to 0 VU = −10 [[dBV]]. The difference between consumer and pro equipment revolves around the cost required to create larger power supplies and output higher levels; consumer levels can be generated by [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered gear, but pro levels require power supplies that plug into the [[mains]].

In [[broadcasting]] equipment, this is termed the '''Maximum Permitted Level''', which is defined by [[European Broadcasting Union]] standards. These devices use [[peak programme meter]]s instead of VU meters, which gives the reading a different meaning.

"[[Microphone|Mic]] level" is sometimes defined as −60 dBV, though levels from microphones vary widely.<ref name="Extron">[http://www.extron.com/technology/glossary.aspx?id=N Extron Electronics Glossary of Terms definition of ''nominal level'']</ref>

In video systems, nominal levels are 1 V<sub>P-P</sub> for synched systems, such as baseband composite video, and 0.7 V<sub>P-P</sub> for systems without sync.<ref name="Extron"/><ref>[http://www.bealecorner.com/trv900/tech/index.html TRV900 Technical Measurements] - "The nominal baseband composite video signal has an amplitude of 1.0 Vpp."</ref><ref>[http://www.epanorama.net/links/videosignal.html  Video Signal Standards and Conversion Page] - "The Y signal has a nominal level of 1Vpp and C signal a level of around 0.5V.", "The nominal signal level is 1Vpp on a 75 ohm terminated line." </ref> Note that these levels are measured peak-to-peak, while audio levels are time averages.
