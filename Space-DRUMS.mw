'''Space-DRUMS''' ('''Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix System''') is a dodecahedron-shaped device intended for use to manipulate [[sound waves]] as a means to create materials only possibly in the conditions of space.According to NASA's website the land mine looking device can completely suspend a baseball-sized solid or liquid sample using a collection of 20 acoustic beam emitters.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/SpaceDRUMS.html Space-Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix System (SpaceDRUMS)]</ref>. The Space-DRUMS project is a collaborative endeavor between Canadian scientist Jacques Guigne and NASA. <ref>[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-09/expensive-space-barrel-uses-sound-waves-grow-contamination-free-materials ISS's New Reactor Uses Sound Waves to To Form Materials Attainable Only In Space.
