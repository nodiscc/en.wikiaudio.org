The actual MaxMSP files needed to create this patch are '''Grubly.maxpat''' and '''DistortionAndDelays.maxpat'''.

To run the patch you must download both of those files and put them in the same folder. 
Then run the patch '''DistortionAndDelays''' from within that folder.

You should be able to trigger it via a MIDI keyboard and play it as-is. Make sure the DAC (the speaker icon) is enabled. Just click it so that it is blue.
