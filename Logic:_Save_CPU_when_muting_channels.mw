==Logic 9==

Go to '''Preferences / Audio / General /'''  then  '''Track Mute / Solo'''

Set it to '''CPU Saving''' to free up resources when you mute or solo a channel.


==Logic 8: disable track when muting (to save CPU)==

In Logic 8 when a channel with plug-ins is muted it still uses CPU resources.
You can change this so that when a channel is muted Logic "disables" the track hence freeing up the CPU. 

Go to:


'''Preferences / Audio / Mute Solo / Slow CPU saving'''
