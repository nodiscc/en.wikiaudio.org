A '''microphone preamp''' ('''microphone pre-amplifier'''), most commonly called '''mic preamp''', is a device used to amplify the [[voltage]] taken from a [[microphone]] to a higher, more usable level. Most microphones must be used in conjunction with a microphone preamp to function properly.

=== The Technical Details === 

The output voltage on a microphone is very low; a microphone preamp increases that level by up to 70dB to a +4dB level output which is used by other external audio effects, for audio recording, and for live sound. The circuitry inside the microphone preamp has a great effect on the sound of a microphone, from the way the microphone reacts due to impedance changes, to adding coloration from transformers or vacuum tubes (valves), op amps, transistors, and all the other circuitry used.

=== In Use ===

Most [[audio engineer]]s would assert that a microphone preamp affects the sound quality of a recording just as much as the microphone itself. Different combinations of microphones and preamps can achieve a wide range of tone, character and mood. Microphone preamps come in many shapes and sizes, and vary greatly in price from a few dollars to many thousands of dollars. Many [[mixing board]]s or desks have microphone preamps built in. There are also a plethora of external preamps from which to choose, which is great for adding the exact tone and feature set one needs for setup. 

Some preamps exist as one part of a [[channel strip]], which can include other kinds of audio recording devices such as [[compressor]]s, [[equalization]] (EQ), [[noise gate]]s, and [[exciter (effect)|enhancers]].
