'''AMS Neve Ltd''' was the result of the amalgamation in 1992 of AMS (Advanced Music Systems) with Neve Electronics International, also known simply as Neve for historical reasons, a legendary British mixing console manufacturer that originated in the work of Rupert Neve in the 1960s. Neve analogue consoles have been considered to be of such high quality that many of twenty or thirty years of age are still in use today at recording studios around the worldâ€”even as digital audio has taken over many aspects of recording technology.
