The '''Noise Reduction Coefficient''' (commonly abbreviated '''NRC''') is a scalar  representation of the amount of [[sonic|sound]] [[energy]] absorbed upon striking a particular surface.  An NRC of 0 indicates perfect [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]; an NRC of 1 indicates perfect [[absorption (acoustics)|absorption]].

In particular, it is the average of four sound [[absorption coefficient]]s of the particular surface at frequencies of 250 [[Hertz|Hz]], 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz.  These frequencies encompass the [[fundamental frequencies]] and first few [[overtones]] of typical human [[Speech communication|speech]], and, therefore, the NRC provides a decent and simple quantification of how well the particular surface will absorb the [[human voice]].  A more broad frequency range should be considered for applications such as music or controlling mechanical noise.

Specifications for materials used in sound absorption commonly include an NRC for simplicity, in addition to more detailed [[frequency]] vs [[amplitude]] charts.

Acoustical materials manufacturers often report NRC values higher than 1.0 due to the way the number is calculated in a laboratory. A test material's area does not include the sides of the panel (which are exposed to the test chamber) which vary due to its thickness. A certain percentage of the sound will be absorbed by the side of the panel due to diffraction effects.
