A '''discrete device''' (or discrete component) is an electronic component with just one [[circuit]] element, either passive ([[resistor]], [[capacitor]], [[inductor]], [[diode]]) or active ([[transistor]] or [[vacuum tube]]).

The phrase ''discrete device'' is also used to distinguish equipment built with individual components from equipment built with integrated circuits. The former is typically more time consuming and costly, but they are considered by many musicians and audio engineers as sonically superior.
