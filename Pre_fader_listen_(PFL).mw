'''Pre fader''' listen or PFL is a monitor function that lets an audio engineer hear a single instrument or group of instruments without affecting the headphone monitor mix, recorded tracks, or mixdown signal.
PFL allows you to listen to the channel's audio at a point before the fader takes effect.
