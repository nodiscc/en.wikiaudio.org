Grooves are snapshots of transients from audio material; or note placement and velocity information from [[MIDI]] material that can then be applied to other audio or MIDI files.
The most conventional use for this is to take the "Groove" of one drum performance and apply it to another as a way of capturing some of the "feel" of the former.

==Extracting Grooves==


To extract grooves right click (or CTRL click) on a MIDI or Audio file in either the arrange or session views. Then choose '''Extract Groove(s)'''

==Applying Grooves==
You can apply any grooves you have extracted to any audio or MIDI data. To do this go to the clip view area ('''View/Session'''. Then click a [[Ableton Live:Creating clips|clip]]) for a selected file and click the menu below '''Groove'''. The grooves you have extracted should be displayed there and will be named after the files they were taken from.

You can preview different Grooves by simply selecting them and playing the file. Once you want to apply it permanently you can click the '''Commit''' button.

====Base====
This is the beat subdivision that the groove and assigned clips get measured against

====Quantize====
This is the amount of quantization that will be applied to assigned clips prior to being requantized by the groove.

====Timing====
This is how strong the groove effect will be on assigned clips

====Random====
This invokes random timing fluctuations for "humanization" purposes

====Velocity====
This is how much the grooves velocities will affect the velocities of the assigned clips

====Global Groove Amount====
This is an overall value that encompasses the strength of timing,random and velocities that are applied to all grooves
