=====Mono (No attenuation)=====
This option will create a mono file by summing the left and right channels.This will also lead to an increased signal level of the file due to the combining of both channels of audio.

=====Mono (With 3.5 dB Attenuation)=====
This option creates a mono file but also compensates for any level increase by attenuating the material by 3.5 dB.

=====Stereo=====
Use this option to create a stereo file.The file will be interleaved or split based on the option chosen in the format menu.

=====Same as source=====

This creates a file that has the same channel properties as the bundle or output selected in the '''Source''' menu

====Resolution====

The resolution allows you to set the sample format (also called [[bit depth]]) of the bounce.

====Import====

The import option allows you to determine if the bounce is imported back into the session once the bounce is done. You have three options. 
=====Do not import=====
Choose this option if you only want the bounced audio to appear on the hard drive and not in the session itself.

=====Add to soundbites window=====
Choose this option to add the bounced file to the soundbites list.

This option will automatically create a new audio track once the bounce to disk is done and add the audio file to the track.
