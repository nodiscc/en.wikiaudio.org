If you want to revert back to the original version of an edited [[Soundbite (Digital Performer)|soundbite]] you can '''open the soundbites window''' and choose the soundbite that ''was'' the original version and drag it to a track, then delete the previous soundbite on that track. Digital Performer creates new soundbites for most edits to audio files. The default display lists the soundbites in a numbered manner where the original soundbite is listed without a number.
