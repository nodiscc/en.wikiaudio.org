'''Zone of Silence Acoustics''':  Refers to an area where sound rays cannot penetrate a.k.a. sound shadow.  Often found outdoors where lowering temperatures with height combine with the ground leading to upward refraction resulting in a sound shadow near the ground beyond a certain radius from the source.
