==Facebook Application==

iLike has a free Facebook application which allows users to play clips of music they like on their profile, show concerts they are going to and play a music trivia quiz. The application had great success after its release, making it one of the most popular applications on the Facebook Platform. As of November 2007, iLike has more than 15 million users.

In April 2009, iLike renamed this application to simply "Music" to maintain consistency with other Facebook apps.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/applications/iLike/2413267546 iLike Facebook application page.]</ref>
