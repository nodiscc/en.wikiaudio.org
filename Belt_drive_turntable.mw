There are two main types of phonograph turntable drives still being manufactured today, the '''belt-drive''' and direct-drive systems; the names are based upon the type of motor system found in each.

In a belt drive turntable the motor is located under and to the side of the platter and is connected to the platter by an elastomeric belt.

The design of the belt drive turntable allows the use of a less expensive motor than the direct-drive turntable. Also, the elastomeric belt absorbs motor vibrations which would otherwise be picked up by the stylus.
