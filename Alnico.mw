'''Alnico'''  is an acronym referring to magnetic (iron) alloys which in addition to iron are composed primarily of aluminium (Al), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co), hence al-ni-co, with the addition of copper, and sometimes titanium. Formations of the alloy are and have been used in guitar pick-ups and speaker construction.
