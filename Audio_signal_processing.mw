'''Audio signal processing''', sometimes referred to as audio processing, is the processing of a representation of auditory signals, or sound. The representation can be digital or analog.

The focus in audio signal processing is most typically a mathematical analysis of which parts of the signal are audible. For example, a signal can be modified for different purposes such that the modification is controlled in the auditory domain.

Which parts of the signal are heard and which are not is determined both by physiology of the human hearing system and by human psychology. These properties are analyzed within the field of psychoacoustics.
