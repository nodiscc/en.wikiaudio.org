A '''soundwalk''' is the empirical method proposed by R. Murray Schafer for identifying a soundscape for a specific location. In a soundwalk you are supposed to move through a limited geographic area, with your ears as open as possible, registrating all the environmental sounds that you hear.

Perception happens according to Schafer in three categories: keynote sound, figure sound and soundmarks. Keynote is the basic environmental sound that is steady, predictable and always there. It is the base of the sound. Figure sounds are in the front of the perceptive focus. They are surprising, sudden or annoying. Soundmarks are these sounds that you identify a place with consciously. It can be the special sound of a clock tower, a tourist attraction or a special acoustic.
