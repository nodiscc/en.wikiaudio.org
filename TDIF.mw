The '''Tascam Digital Interface''' ('''TDIF''') is a proprietary format connector defined by [[TASCAM]] that is unbalanced and uses a 25-pin [[D-subminiature|D-sub]] cable to transmit and/or receive up to eight channels of [[digital audio]] between compatible devices. Unlike the [[ADAT]] lightpipe connection, TDIF uses a bidirectional connection, meaning that only one cable is required to connect the eight ins and outs of one device or another.

The Initial specification available to implementers was called TDIF-1 Version 1.0.

The first product with this connector was the TASCAM DA-88.  That implementation did not include the ability to derive a [[word clock]] syncronization between the DA-88 and another TDIF-1 device, so a BNC WORD CLOCK connection was required as well.(cite: DA-88 users manual)  Later TASCAM products included the ability to sync to the TDIF-1 connection, although that still excluded the DA-88. (cite:DA-38 users manual). Other manufacturers vary in their completeness of implementation. <ref>See [http://www.mackie.com/support/FAQ/d8b_detailed.html#dio8 Mackie D8B FAQ]</ref>

The signal labelled "word clock" in the TDIF-1 spec is delayed 270 degrees (90 degrees advanced) with respect to the word clock visible from the BNC word clock output.  This is because the TDIF-1 spec was derived from the digital audio transmitter of the NEC uPD6381 [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] used in the DA-88.

The TDIF-1 Version 1.1 specification includes parity and other channel information bits.
TDIF-1 Version 2.0 includes specification for double speed and quad speed (e.g. 96kHz and 192kHz) rates at reduced channel counts.<ref>See tascam.com DA-78HR or DA-98HR details</ref>

The TASCAM X-48 supports 96kHz at full channel count over 6 TDIF-1 connectors, using a post Version 2.0 specification. <ref>See tascam.com X48 webpage</ref>
