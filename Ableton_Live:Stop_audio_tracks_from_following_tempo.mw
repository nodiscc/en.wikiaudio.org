Audio files dragged to Ableton Live tracks are automatically set to conform to any tempo changes that are made to the session. Sometimes , especially if you wish to use Abletone Live as a conventional [[DAW]] you might not want tracks to "conform" to the set tempo.


Here's how you disable this feature.


Go to the top menu '''Live / Preferences'''

Then in the dialog box that appears select the side menu that says '''Record/Warp/Launch'''

Then set '''Auto-Warp Long Samples''' to '''Off'''

Now if you drag and drop an audio file to a track (not a clip) it will retain it's original speed irrespective of the tempo live is set to.
