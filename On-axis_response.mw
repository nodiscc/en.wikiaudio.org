'''On axis''' when referring to [[microphone]]s is normally just referred to as the microphone's [[frequency response]].

When referring to ''microphone placement'' in a recording environment on-axis is a reference to direct positioning of a microphone at a sound source. In other words if a microphone is pointed '''off-axis''' at a sound source it means the microphone is ''not'' pointed directly at the source.

With speakers the on-axis response is measured directly in front of its cabinet. The on-axis response of a speaker is generally the best (or flattest) response that a speakers produces.
