'''MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3''', more commonly referred to as '''MP3''', is a digital audio encoding format using a form of lossy data compression. 

 
This encoding format is used to create the MP3's small file, as a way to store a single segment of audio, commonly a song, such that the file can be easily organized and transferred between computers or other devices such as MP3 players.
