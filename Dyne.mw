In physics, the '''dyne''' (symbol "dyn", from Greek δύναμις (dynamis) meaning power, force) is a unit of force specified in the centimetre-gram-second (CGS) system of units, a predecessor of the modern SI. One dyne is equal to exactly 10 micronewtons. Further, the dyne can be defined as "the force required to accelerate a mass of one gram at a rate of one centimetre per second squared". A term meaning redirect.

1 dyn = 1 g·cm/s² = 10−5 kg·m/s² = 10 µN

The dyne per centimetre is the unit usually associated with measuring surface tension. For example, the surface tension of distilled water is 72 dyn/cm at 25°C (77°F).
