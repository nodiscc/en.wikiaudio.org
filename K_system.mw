The '''K-System''' is a protocol for setting mix and monitor calibrations in a studio environment. Introduced by mastering engineer Bob Katz in 1999, the system is an attempt to standardize leveling practices throughout the audio industry. It uses three separate standards known as K-20, K-14, and K-12. With each step (K-20, K-14, K-12 respectively), the available dynamic range decreases as the average level increases. This versatility allows the K-System to accommodate a wide range of audio material and mediums.
