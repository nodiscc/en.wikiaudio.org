The '''Access Virus''' is a German made virtual analog synthesizer which was first produced in 1997 and has since been upgraded frequently, with the company releasing new models about every two years. The latest of these are the Access Virus TI, Polar and Snow models, the first two of these were released in November 2005, the Snow has been released in February 2008.

== Technical details ==

All of the Viruses are DSP-powered, virtual analog synthesizers. They have classic analog-style oscillators which can be tuned continuously from a pure sine wave to a square wave (with variable pulse-width modulation), as well as 63 "spectral" waveforms which are entirely synthetic, non-analog style waves. With the TI series new oscillator models were added like Hypersaw and Wavetable oscillators. The Virus comes with many different types of analog styles and digital distortion, as well as filter saturation.

The filter section is highly customisable, compared to most other synthesizers, with the Viruses having two independent resonant filters that can be combined in various ways to produce a unique sound. The synthesizer is somewhat a modular synthesizer with many routing possibilities, particularly in the envelopes.

An outstanding feature of the TI series is "Total Integration": It is currently the only synthesizer that can be fully integrated in a current computer based audio workstation as a VST or AU plugin, including the advantages of sample accurate MIDI timing, host automation as well as total recall.
