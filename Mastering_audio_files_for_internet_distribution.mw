This is a list of guidelines to follow when mastering audio for internet distribution, specifically using the MP3 file format.




==Guidelines==

*Use the highest quality file available.

*If using [[MP3]] as your target file type, cut some of the high frequencies.MP3's have difficulty with these frequencies. 

*Busy mixes have a tendency to lose punch.Sparse mixes translate better.

* Make sure the level is hot. Normalize if necessary.

*With MP3's your encoder might sound better at 32kHz than 44.1 kHz

*Leave some dynamic range, don't compress too much.

*Use multi-band compression sparingly. It confuses the encoding algorithm

*Set encoder option to highest quality setting.  

*Limit the output of the material intended for Mp3 to -1. not -.1
The reason for this is many encoders output hotter than the source material.
