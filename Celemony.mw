'''Celemony Software GmbH''' is a German musical software company that specializes in digital audio pitch correction software. Celemony is based in Munich, Germany and was founded in October 2000 by Peter Neubäcker, Prof. Dr. Hildegard Sourgens and Carsten Gehle.

Peter Neubäcker, one of the founders of the company was developing their product, Melodyne, as a research experiment with sound for around 3 years before the company was founded.

Melodyne is primarily a pitch correction tool, used by many record producers around the world to perfectly tune and manipulate audio signals, typically vocals. But Melodyne can also be used for time-stretching, completely rebuilding a melody, or the creation of backing vocals from a lead vocal recording. The public first saw Melodyne at the Winter NAMM Show in 2001 and it has since won various awards.
