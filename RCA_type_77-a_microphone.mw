The '''[[RCA]] Type 77-A microphone''' was a [[simplex]] (''uni-directional'') [[ribbon microphone]], the forerunner of the [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone]].   The 77-A was designed [[Harry F. Olson|Dr. Harry F. Olson]] sometime during the late [[1920s]] or early [[1930s]]; prototypes are rumored to have existed in 1929 and 1930, but the 77-A was not announced until 1932.

The 77-A would set the standard for all other RCA ribbon microphone comparisons for the next 40 years.

==Construction==

It featured an acoustic labyrinth inside the case and two vertical in-line ribbons which enabled it to be uni-directional.
