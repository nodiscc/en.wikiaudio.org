'''2.''' Click on the region you want to affect.

'''3.''' A window will appear with a choice of a few different algorithms called "'''flex modes'''"(such as rhythmic, [[Polyphony|polyphonic]], [[monophonic]] etc) pick the one that reflects the qualities of the audio region the most.  
4.Click the part of the audio file you want to expand or compress and move it to where you want it to land relative to the time grid.
