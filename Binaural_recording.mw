'''Binaural recording''' is a method of recording audio which uses a special microphone arrangement intended for replay using headphones. Dummy head recording refers to a specific method of capturing the audio, generally using a bust including pinnae (outer ears). As one's pinnae are unique, and the filtering they impose on sound directionality is learned by individuals from early childhood, use during recording of pinnae that are not the same as the ultimate listener may lead to perceptual confusion.

The term "binaural" has frequently been confused as a synonym for the word "stereo", and this is partially due to a large amount of misuse in the mid-1950s by the recording industry, as a marketing buzzword. Conventional stereo recordings do not factor in natural ear spacing or "head-shadow" of the head and ears, since these things happen naturally as a person listens, generating their own ITDs (interaural time differences) and ILDs (interaural level differences). Because loudspeaker-crosstalk of conventional stereo interferes with binaural reproduction, either headphones are required, or crosstalk cancellation of signals intended for loudspeakers such as Ambiophonics. For listening using conventional speaker-stereo, or mp3 players, a pinna-less dummy head may be preferable for quasi-binaural recording, such as the sphere microphone or Ambiophone. As a general rule, for true binaural results, an audio recording and reproduction system chain, from microphone to listener's brain, should contain one and only one set of pinnae (preferably the listener's own) and one head-shadow.
