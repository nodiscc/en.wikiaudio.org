A '''banana connector''' (commonly banana plug for the male, banana jack for the female) is a single-wire (one conductor) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment. The plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment. They are also used as the plugs on the cables connecting the amplifier to the loudspeakers in a hi-fi sound system.
