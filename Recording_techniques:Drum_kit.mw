=Dual Microphone Full Kit Techniques=

==Stereo X-Y==
This technique uses two condenser microphone with cardioid polar patterns. The microphones are placed at a 90 degree angle to one another at about 3 feet above the cymbals. The [[Cartesian coordinate system|horizontal and vertical plane positioning]] should be the same for both microphone capsules and they should be close enough that they're ''nearly'' touching each other

== Wide Stereo Overheads ==


This technique requires the use of two cardioid condenser microphones placed 1-3 inches apart over the drum set and placed at a 90 degree angle pointed away from one another as displayed in the image below.

[[Image:Drum miking wide stereo overheads.png|500px]]











== Head baffle technique ==
This technique uses two cardioid condenser microphones positioned side-by-side with the drummers ears and pointed toward the front of the kit. The microphones should be four to eight inches from the drummers head 

[[Image:Head baffle drum miking .png|500px]]

==One microphone overhead & one in kick==

For this technique one cardioid condenser microphone is overhead pointing down at the drum kit.
The other microphone is a dynamic microphone and is placed inside the kick drum aimed at the head, about half way between the center of the head & the shell



[[Image:Drums one mic overhead one in kick.png|500px]]



==MS Stereo Technique==


[[image:MSDiagram.jpg‎|right]]

M/S stereo is short for Mid-side stereo. MS Stereo microphones exist but you can also create the effect with a good quality cardioid mic and condenser with a figure 8 polar pattern.


=== Setup ===


*Place the cardioid mic where you would normally position it to capture direct sound from the source and place the figure-8 mic with its diaphragm at a 90-degree angle to the diaphragm of the Cardioid  mic. The Cardiod microphone is called the mid mic and the fig 8 is called the side mic.


=== Analog recording===


#Bring the Figure 8 mix up into a console and then take a feed from the [[direct]] out of that [[channel]] and bring it back in via a line input on another channel 
#Bring up the cardioid mic and center pan it.
#Take the two channels of the [[figure 8]] microphone and [[pan]] one left and one right. Now reverse the [[phase]] of one of the splits.Listen to the cardioid signal and bring up the signal from the condenser mic and you will hear the [[sound]] change from [[mono]] to a wide [[stereo]] signal. 



When you mono the figure 8 signal, the left and right signal should cancel each other out and leave the cardioid mono signal.

=== Digital recording ===

For digital recording you can either follow the directions above (they will work perfectly fine)'' or'' instead of splitting the signal of the figure 8 mic as posted in step #1 above, you can simply record both mics on their own respective tracks and then take the figure 8 mic track and copy it to another track after recording. You should then have 2 figure 8 tracks. Now simply phase reverse one of them using a phase reverse feature of your DAW and pan one track hard left and the other hard right.

=Triple Microphone Full Kit Techniques=

==Kick, Snare and Overhead==

This techniques uses 1 cardioid condenser microphone placed two feet above the cymbals and pointed down at the set.
Another cardioid dynamic microphone is then pointed at the snare from a distance of about 2 inches. The third microphone is a dynamic cardioid microphone inside the kick and positioned to personal taste.


[[Image:Drum recording 3 mics kick snare overhead.png|500px]]



==X-Y and Kick==

For this technique use two cardioid condenser microphones in an XY configuration. Then mike the inside of the kick with a dynamic cardioid microphone.

=Quadruple Microphone Full Kit Techniques=

==Glyn Johns Technique==

[[Glyn Johns]] is a famous recording engineer. Born in England in 1942, Mr. Johns has recorded many well known musicians including Eric Clapton, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Steve Miller, and The Eagles.



=== Microphone Selection ===


This technique involves four microphones - two overhead microphones,a kick mic, and a snare mic.
For this tutorial we suggest these microphones.
Note: it only sounds good if you have a good sounding room and a good drummer.

'''Kick:''' [[AKG D112]]

'''Snare:''' [[Shure SM57]]

'''Overheads:''' 2 [[Beyerdynamic M160]] [[ribbon microphone]]s

===Position Your Overheads===
Note: you'll need a tape measure for this exercise

Position the first overhead mic 40-60 inches from dead-center of the focal point of the kit (e.g snare drum), facing directly downward to the kick drum pedal.

Position the second overhead mic's diaphragm towards the high-hat, over the tops of the floor tom and snare drum. The microphone will be positioned facing the drummer on his right side.
Take the tape measure, and position the microphone's diaphragm exactly the same distance of the overhead microphone (e.g 40"-60") inches from the center of the snare. Below is a picture representing how this should roughly look from the front of the drum kit.

[[image:Glyn Johns drum micing.JPG|500px]]

===Position Your Spot Mics===
Position your snare and Kick mics. These positions are a matter of personal preference.

===Panning In The Mix===
Panning the microphones in your mix once you've recorded is what makes the Glyn Johns Method work.

Pan your kick and snare mics to the center. Then, take your overhead mics, and pan the one above the snare halfway to the right. Next, pan your other overhead mic -- the one near the floor tom -- to the far left. This gives a depth and stereo image to the overall kit.


==Recorderman technique==
{{#evp:youtube|IiFOD1EeKhQ|If this video doesn't play please [[Submit_Request|submit a request to remove it]]|right|300}}

"'''Recorderman'''" is a drum technique that comes from a user of the same name who posts on the recording.org forums and is credited with popularizing the technique written below. <ref> [http://www.hometracked.com/2007/05/12/recorderman-overhead-drum-mic-technique/ Hometracked.com recorder man overhead mic drum technique] </ref>

=== Mic Placement ===

#Place the "Left" overhead mic directly over the center of the snare at the height of two drum sticks-held end-to-end(from the center of the snare, straight up, to the capsule of the mic).

#Next; take the drum sticks (still held end-to-end) from the center of the snare over to above your ( i.e." the drummers") right shoulder and place your "right" overhead mic here.

#Listen with headphones and have the drummer hit his kick drum while the sound engineer adjusts the mix panning of both mic signals until the kick is centered.However, you should be able to pan both signals hard left and hard right with the result being the snare and kick remaining in the center position of the mix

==XY, Kick & Snare==

This technique requires two condenser microphones placed in an XY configuration. One cardioid dynamic microphone placed inside the kick. And one cardioid dynamic microphone pointed at the snare drum at a distance of about 2 inches above the top head
