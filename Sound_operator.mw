The '''sound operator''' (also commonly called '''production audio engineer''', '''audio engineer''', '''sound board operator''', '''sound technician''', '''sound mixer''' or '''A1''') is the person responsible for the overall and total execution of all sound-related aspects of a theatrical performance. This job may include operating a [[mixing console]] and [[sound reinforcement system]], as well as co-ordinating [[sound effects]] and mixing [[microphone]]s. The sound operator reports to the [[sound designer]], [[stage manager]], and [[technical director]].

The specific duties of the position vary from one production to another, but a sound board operator is generally required to know how to use the various playback media (decks) that pre-recorded sound cues will play from, the sound console that controls the levels and individual channel [[EQ]] settings, as well as other sound-related devices, such as [[graphic equalizer]]s, and various other [[effects processor]]s. More often than in the case of other theatrical designers, a [[sound designer]] may be expected to serve the function of board operator. Since sound execution relies heavily on variables that may change from one performance and the next even within a given production (i.e. the volume at which an [[actor]] speaks), sound board operators must be extremely familiar with the sound designer's intentions. 

Aside from the specifics of the show, the sound board operator must also be familiar with the house sound system at the venue they're working for, as they are often called upon to make repairs and adjustments to the system as required.

As per [[IATSE]] bylaws, the sound department is a subset of the electrics department.  Any person in the sound department is technically hired as an electrician for a union contract and will also report to the [[master electrician]].  It is not uncommon in smaller theatres and for productions requiring relatively little audio support, the role  of sound operator may be assigned to someone else such as an electrician or assistant stage manager.

In touring theatre, the sound operator is responsible for getting the sound system installed and running, and smoothly integrated with the venue and any of the local equipment. This often includes backstage and front-of-house intercom, video monitors and cameras, auxiliary speakers (under the balcony or in the lobby), backstage and dressing room audio monitors, public address microphones and assistive listening devices.

In larger productions, the sound operator is typically assisted by one or more '''A2'''s (link below).

The title "Sound Operator" is often reserved for plays, speeches, presentations and other productions requiring little skill in the audio department on a relatively simple audio system.  For larger, musical productions with many actors, musicians, microphones and/or other inputs, the term "audio engineer" is appropriate.    These productions require greater skill due to the larger scale of the system being used as well as a more acute hearing being required to generate (or "engineer") a quality audio mix.  Calling a "sound engineer" a "sound operator" is often taken as an insult by the engineer.
