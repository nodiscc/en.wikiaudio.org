In telecommunications and electronics, '''baud''' (pronounced /ˈbɔːd/, unit symbol "Bd") is synonymous to symbols/s or pulses/s. It is the unit of symbol rate, also known as baud rate or modulation rate; the number of distinct symbol changes (signalling events) made to the transmission medium per second in a digitally modulated signal or a line code. The baud rate is related to but should not be confused with gross bit rate expressed in bit/s.
