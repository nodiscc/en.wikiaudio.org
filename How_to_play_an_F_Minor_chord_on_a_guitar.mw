==F Minor==
        
#Place your index finger flat so that it covers the 1st, 2nd and 3rd strings on the 1st fret.
#Place your ring finger on the 4th string, 3rd fret
#Start at the 4th string and play each of the strings below in quick succession.
#Do not play either the 6th or the 5th strings



The F Minor Chord can be tough if you haven't built up your finger strength yet. Just
keeping all of the strings fretted with your index finger can be
difficult at first. Try starting with just your index finger and then
add your ring finger when you are comfortable holding down all three
notes.
