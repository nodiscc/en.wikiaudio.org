== Importing Audio ==



The next thing you need to do is record or import your audio into the program. To import you can either drag and drop to one of the tracks or use the File/Import function. If you would rather record directly into Melodyne you can jump to the record section of this tutorial. After you have added audio to your track it should looks similar to the image below. The bright orange and yellow sections are called "blobs" and they represent the different notes of a performance.

Once the audio file is imported, Melodyne saves the tempo and pitch information of your file as a .[[MDD file extention|mdd]] file.
You can now open up the editing window by double clicking on one of the tracks or "blobs". The result should look similar to the image below:
