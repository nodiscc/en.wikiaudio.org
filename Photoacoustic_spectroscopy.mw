'''Photoacoustic spectroscopy''' is based on the photoacoustic effect. The discovery of the photoacoustic effect dates to 1880 when Alexander Graham Bell showed that thin discs emitted sound when exposed to a beam of sunlight that was rapidly interrupted with a rotating slotted disk. The absorbed energy from the sunlight is transformed into kinetic energy of the sample by energy exchange processes. This results in local heating and thus a pressure wave or sound. Later Bell showed that materials exposed to the non-visible portions of the solar spectrum (i.e., the infrared and the ultraviolet) can also produce sounds. By measuring the sound at different wavelengths, a photoacoustic spectrum of a sample can be recorded that can be used to identify the absorbing components of the sample. The photoacoustic effect can be used to study solids, liquids and gases.
