[[File:Cat 5.png|150px|alt=A cat-5 cable|left]]<br><br>Using Cat-5 wires may be a way of saving a few bucks and getting a few blisters to achieve a 10 gauge wire, if you're up to the task.<br clear="all">

== Things you'll need ==
* 14 lengths of cat-5 cable with '''Teflon''' insulation (cut 1/5 more than what you need)
* The [[How to Make Cables|complete attire]] to make a normal cable

== Steps ==
# [[File:High-quality-RCA-bullet-plug-Eichmann.png|thumb|High quality RCA connectors]]Remove the blue/orange jacket on the cables. You now have 56 pairs of cables.
# Discard one of the pair. You need only 54 pairs. Keep it for another project or recycle the metal at a local scrapyard for some bucks.
# Braid three pairs of wire together. Repeat until you have 18 braids (54 pairs divided by 3).
# Braid three trios of braided wire together. Repeat until you have 6 branches.
# Braid three branches together. Repeat until you have a pair. One will be used for left, other for right channel.
# Separate the solids and the striped wires in both branches, strip and twist them together. One twist will be used as ground.
# Put some solder on the ends.
# Put the heatshrink tubing.
# Put the connectors on the ends and crimp them in place.
# Put more solder.
# Solder the ground pin.
