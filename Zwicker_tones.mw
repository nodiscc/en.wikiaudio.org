'''Zwicker tones''' are a psychoacoustic phenomena whereby a subject listening to a noise that contains all pitches of notes except for one,  reports hearing the missing tone linger, even though it was never played. This phenomena is believed to take place in the brain itself since it can not be explained acoustically.
