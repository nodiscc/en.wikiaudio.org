===Microphone Placement===
'''Each technique begins with a bullet point.'''


*Split the signal into two with a DI box. Send one directly into your mixing console and send the other to a bass amp miced with a large diaphragm [[condenser microphone]].Mix both signals to taste with Eq etc. Possibly experiment with [[Dynamic_range_compression|compression]] on the direct signal. Make sure you check phase relationships
