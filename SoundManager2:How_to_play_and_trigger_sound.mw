First download SoundManager2 and unzip the file to your desktop. It should create a folder called something like soundmanagerv297a-20111220. You can rename this simply to '''Soundmanager2''' if you like.


Create a new folder on your desktop called '''Mysoundtest'''.

Open the SoundManager folder and copy/paste the following folders and file contents into the '''Mysoundtest''' folder.

*'''Script'''
*'''Src'''
*'''Swf'''
*'''Index'''



Now within the '''Mysoundtes'''t folder create another folder called '''audiofiles'''.



Inside the '''audiofiles''' folder add an mp3 file. For our example we will title it '''my.mp3''' (You should do the same for the code below to work).

Make sure your MP3 file does ''not'' have a (accidentally created) double extension.

Open the index file with your text editor and delete its contents. Then copy and paste the below code into it.


<source>
<script type="text/javascript" src="script/soundmanager2.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">

soundManager.flashVersion = 9;

soundManager.url = 'swf/';

soundManager.onready(function(){

soundManager.createSound({

id:"myMp3",

url:"audiofiles/my.mp3",

stream: true,

autoPlay: true,

multiShot: false,

});

soundManager.play('myMp3','my.mp3');});

</script>

</source>



Save the file and relaunch it in your browser. The file should begin playing.

==Troubleshooting==

If the file doesn't play try this.

Go to this link
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html

Click '''Edit Locations'''.

Then click '''Add Locations''' and '''Browse for folder'''.

Then choose the folder with all of the assets, which in this tutorial is the '''Mysoundtest''' folder.

Refresh the browser and relaunch. The file should play.

===Latency===
For latency try using

'''soundManager.useHighPerformance = true''' , and possibly '''soundManager.flashVersion = 9 '''

==Trigger via image click (or other element)==
