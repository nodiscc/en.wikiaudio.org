In '''audio engineering''' (and now in broadcast engineering), audio over Ethernet (sometimes AoE) is the concept of using an Ethernet-based network to transmit digital audio. It is designed to replace bulky snake cables, and to use the existing wiring infrastructure in a facility, providing a reliable backbone for any audio application, such as for multiple studios or stages.
