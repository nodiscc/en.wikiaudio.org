== Logic:Multi takes and composite tracks ==




To record multiple takes to a logic ''audio'' track and then compile them follow these steps.

#Set the input of the audio track(s) you wish to to record your multiple takes to.
#Create a cycle to span the length of time for the takes (the cycle span is the green block in the image below).
#Begin recording your takes

The process should look similiar to the image below.

Now, if you make selections to the  parts of each take ( highlighted in blue in the image below) and push play on the transport, you will hear each selected section.

Once you have all the selections of each track you wish to compile, you can compile it in one of two ways , either refold the track by clicking the [[Image:Logic_multi_take_arrow_.png]]‎  icon (to the left of the track name).

or

Click the [[Image:Multi_take_logic_arrow_(right).png‎]] icon and choose one of the following options.




'''*Flatten'''

This will create a new track with cross fades in between each region.

'''*Flatten and merge'''

This will create a digital mix down of the individual selections hence creating a new audio file.
