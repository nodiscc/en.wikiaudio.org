'''Bakelite''' refers to a plastic created by Leo Baekeland as early as 1907.
The material was used for many household items including radios.
Bakelite is not a brand of radio, but many collectors class radios of that era according to their plastic casing material.Bakelite radios are sometimes confused with [[Catalin (radio)|Catalin]] which is another plastic which became prevalent in the 1920's.
