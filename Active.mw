'''Active''' typically refers to an audio device that requires a power source. This is in contrast to passive devices which don't require a power source.  
Sometimes electrical components used for amplification such as transistors or integrated circuits are referred to as active. <ref>White,Glenn D. Louie J, Gary.(2005) The Audio Dictionary. p. 10. ISBN 0295984988</ref>
