'''Acetate''' is a word to describe a metal disk coated with lacquer and cellulose nitrate that an audio signal is recorded to as a precursor to the manufacturing and duplication of a vinyl record. Acetate is a misnomer since the actual disc is not made of acetate. <ref>White,Glenn D. Louie J, Gary.(2005) The Audio Dictionary. p. 7. ISBN 0295984988</ref>
