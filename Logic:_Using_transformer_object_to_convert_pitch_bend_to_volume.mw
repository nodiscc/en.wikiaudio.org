Set it up as a [[Logic: Environment MIDI effects destructive and non destructive|destructive connection]] ( between the physical input and sequencer input)


'''2.''' Double click the transformer object to open its editing window ( shown below )

'''3.''' Emulate the settings shown in the image below. These settings are what will convert incoming pitch data to 
volume information.
