A '''Noise Gate''' or gate is an electronic device or computer software application that allows an audio signal to pass through only when it is above a set threshold (level). If the signal falls below the threshold no signal is allowed to pass. This is done to decrease the amount of noise when recording as well as on individual channels during mixdown to decrease the accumulation of noise from the combination of multiple tracks playing at once.
