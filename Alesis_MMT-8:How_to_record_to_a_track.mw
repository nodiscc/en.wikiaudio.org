To record to an MMT-8 track first you need to select a track to record to.
Do this by pushing the part button so that it is lit. Then ''hold down'' the record button and then select the track you would like to record to. Keep in mind you will overwrite any material on that track.

Make sure the record button is lit. Push the play button.

You are now recording to your selected track
