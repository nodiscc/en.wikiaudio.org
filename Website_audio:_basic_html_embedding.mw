== Web audio html embed tutorial==



#Upload the audio file to your webserver and make sure it is in the same directory as your website. 

#Copy and paste the following code onto your website:

<source><EMBED SRC="myaudiofile.wav" VOLUME="50" HEIGHT="60" WIDTH="144"></source>




Replace the "myaudiofile.wav" with the name of your audio file. Keep the quotation marks. This embeds the audio and creates a player that allows you to turn the audio on and off.

#Adjust volume, height and width settings to match your website by changing the respective values in the code :   
 <source> VOLUME="50" HEIGHT="60" WIDTH="144"</source>
