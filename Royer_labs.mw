'''Royer Labs''' is a microphone company that many consider to be one of the foremost manufacturer of ribbon microphones. The reasons most often cited for this opinion is that Royer has combined the traditional warmth of vintage ribbon microphones with the strength of modern materials. While older ribbon microphones had a great sound, the ribbons were weak and would break easily. Royer microphones, however, are strong enough to be placed in front of electric guitar amps, a placement that older ribbons could not have weathered.
