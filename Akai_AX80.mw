The '''AX80''' is a polyphonic analogue keyboard synthesizer manufactured by Akai Professional in the mid-1980s. It was Akai's first venture into the professional electronic musical instrument market. The AX80 used digitally-controlled analogue oscillators and filter circuitry based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3372 integrated circuit. It was marketed as part of a line of project studio equipment, including the S612 digital sampler and the MG1212 multitrack tape recorder, at a price of $1,695 US.
