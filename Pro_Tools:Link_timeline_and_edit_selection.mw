When making selections in the Pro Tools edit window you can choose to link or unlink the timeline selection with the edit selection.

When the '''link timeline and edit selection''' option is turned ''on'' then the selection used to edit regions and the selection in the timeline will be connected. When the Timeline and Edit Selection are ''unlinked'' (set to off) then these two selections will be independent of one another. See the images below
