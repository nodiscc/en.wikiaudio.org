A '''trimmer''' is a miniature adjustable electrical component. It is meant to be set correctly when installed in some device, and never seen or adjusted by the device's user. Trimmers can be variable resistors (potentiometers) or variable capacitors. They are common in precision circuitry like A/V components, and may need to be adjusted when the equipment is serviced. Unlike other variable controls, trimmers are mounted directly on circuit boards, turned with a small screwdriver and rated for many fewer adjustments over their lifetime. In 1952, Marlan Bourns patented the world's first trimming potentiometer, trademarked TrimpotÂ®.
