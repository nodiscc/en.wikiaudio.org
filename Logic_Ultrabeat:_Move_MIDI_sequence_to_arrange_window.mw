To move an Ultrabeat sequence to an instrument track click and hold the icon displayed in the image below.
Then drag this to the same track the Ultrabeat is playing from.If you intend on doing your editing strictly from the arrange window you might want to turn the Ultrabeat sequencer off, otherwise both sequences will play.
