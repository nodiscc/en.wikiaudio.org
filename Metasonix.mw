'''Metasonix''' is an American audio equipment manufacturer, founded by Eric Barbour and located in Lakeport, California.

Metasonix produces audio effects and synthesizers, using atypical vintage vacuum tubes; such as special types made for TV sets, FM modulation detector tubes for cheap FM radios, and radio pentodes. Metasonix modules are notorious for their high cost, high power consumption (as much as 100 times greater than for similar solid-state circuits), and peculiar highly-distorted sounds. Inspection of a Metasonix TM-1 reveals that, as the company advertises, the entire signal path depends on three vacuum tubes--there appear to be no transistors or integrated circuit chips directly in the path, while a single IC chip is used as the ring-modulator oscillator.
