A process of regenerating SMPTE timecode from an original source which is used to repair decayed timecode as well as for new copies. 

'''Jam sync''' refers to the practice of applying a phase hit to a system to bring it in synchronization with another. The term originates from the use of this technique to replace defective time code on a video tape recording by replacing it with a new time code sequence, which may be an extension of a previous good time code sequence on an earlier part of the source material .
