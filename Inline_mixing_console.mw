An '''inline mixing''' console is one where the monitor and record path can be monitored via each channel strip.

This is in contrast to a split mixing console where the monitor and record path are designated their own respective channels on the console. This is usually done where one half of the console is used monitor recording and the other half is used to monitor playback - hence the phrase split console
