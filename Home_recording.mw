'''Home recording''' means recording at home rather than in a professional studio. It has lately become more popular due to the increase of affordable digital and analog recording equipment. One can have one's own semi-professional recording studio, depending on the quality and extent of their equipment, in the comfort of one's own home as opposed to paying a larger studio by the hour for their services. Home recording may include (or be completely performed upon) a personal computer (PC) which allows for upgrade prospects and high-definition, studio-grade and digital recording mixing.
