An audio '''channel strip''' may be a stand alone unit or one of many units built into a mixing desk. As a minimum, the unit will include a microphone [[preamp]] and some form of audio equalisation. Some designs also offer other facilities including audio compression, de-essing, noise-gating and limiting.

Some examples of stand-alone channel strips are manufactured by the following companies:

*[[Aphex]]
*[[GML]]
*[[PreSonus]]
