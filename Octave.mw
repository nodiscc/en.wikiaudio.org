In music, an '''octave''' is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)


==Electrical relevance==
In electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of ±6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by ±6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2. This response is equivalent to ±20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).
